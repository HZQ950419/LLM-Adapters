1. First, we need to find the area of the bathroom: 

Area = length x width 
Area = 36 sq ft 

2. Next, we need to find how many mosaic tiles Mr Boarden would need for one square foot of the bathroom: 

24 mosaic tiles/sq ft 

3. To find how many mosaic tiles Mr Boarden would need for two thirds of the bathroom, we need to first find the area of two thirds of the bathroom: 

Area of two thirds = (2/3) x 36 sq ft 
Area of two thirds = 24 sq ft 

4. Now we can find how many mosaic tiles Mr Boarden would need for two thirds of the bathroom: 

24 mosaic tiles/sq ft x 24 sq ft = 576 mosaic tiles 

Therefore, Mr Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. The answer in Arabic numerals is

2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20/2 = 10 sheep.
5. Combined, the farm and zoo have 30 + 10 = 40 cows and 20 + 10 = 30 sheep.

Therefore, the farm and zoo have a total of 40 + 30 = 70 animals.</s>

Since Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, we can assume that the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

2. Determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set:
If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $48 - $44 = $4 more to spend on CDs.

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 4 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. The answer in Arabic numerals is 4.</s>

1. Let's start by finding out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, who has $120. So:

Kassidy's money = 3/4 x Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 x 120
Kassidy's money = 90

So Kassidy has $90.

2. We also know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So:

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

So Rayna has $150.

3. Together, Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna have:

Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money = 120 + 90 + 150

1. Let's start by assigning variables to each person's age:
- Let x be the age of one of the twins.
- Let y be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let z be the age of the other triplet.

From the problem, we know that:
- x + y + z = 44 (since their combined ages are 44)
- x = y + 7 (since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet)
- y = z - 7 (since one triplet is 7 years older than the other triplet)

We can use the second equation to substitute for y in the first equation:
x = (z - 7) + 7

Now we can substitute this expression for x into the third equation:
y = (z - 7) - 7

Simplifying this equation, we get:
y = z - 14

Kagiyami = 4 x Saskay = 4 x 12 = 48

So Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high.

2. Next, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain. We know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can, who can lift a mountain 48 inches high.

Naruto = 10 x Kagiyami = 10 x 48 = 480

So Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high.

3. To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

1. Let's start by finding the price of a gold Jewell. Since the price of a diamond Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a gold Jewell, we can set up an equation:

Price of gold Jewell = 4/5 * Price of diamond Jewell

We know that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Price of gold Jewell = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold Jewell = $1600

So the price of a gold Jewell is $1600.

2. Now let's find the price of a silver Jewell. We know that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell, so we can set up another equation:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
Price of silver Jewell = $1600 - $400
Price of silver Jewell = $1200

So the price of a silver Jewell is $120

1. Let's call the number of students in each of the other groups "x". 

2. We know that there are 2 equal groups, so the total number of students in those groups is 2x. 

3. We also know that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, so the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10. 

4. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

2x + x - 10 = 200 

5. Simplifying: 

3x - 10 = 200 

6. Solving for x: 

3x = 210 

7. Multiplying both sides by 3: 

9x = 630

x = 70 

Therefore, there are 70 students in the smallest group.</s>

- Ariadne made $400 from selling red hats in the first month.
- Ariadne made twice as much from selling green hats in the first month.
- Therefore, Ariadne made 2 x $400 = $<<2*400=800>>800 from selling green hats in the first month.

2. In the second month, Ariadne's sales from green hats were 3/4 of the total sales from the first month. We can set up an equation to solve for the total sales from green hats in the second month:

- Ariadne made $800 from selling green hats in the first month.
- Ariadne made 3/4 x $800 = $<<3/4*800=600>>600 from selling green hats in the second month.

1. First, we need to find out how many sentences Mark edits for Publisher B each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences he edits by 2: 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences 

2. Next, we need to find out how much Publisher B pays Mark per sentence. Since they pay him twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply Publisher A's rate by 2: 

5 cents per sentence x 2 = 10 cents per sentence 

3. Now that we know how much Publisher B pays Mark per sentence, we can calculate his total earnings for the week: 

10 cents per sentence x 500 sentences = 5000 cents 

4. To convert cents to dollars, we need to divide by 100: 

5000 cents ÷ 100 = 50 dollars 

Therefore, Mark makes 50 dollars in a week, in cents.

5% of $2000 = 0.05 x $2000 = $100 

So John's salary increased by $100. 

2. Add the monetary reward to the salary increase: 

$2000 + $100 = $2100 

3. Multiply John's weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year: 

$2100 x 52 = $11,040 

Therefore, John made $11,040 that year.</s>

1. Let's call the amount of water in the small pool "x".
2. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so it had 2x gallons.
3. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so it has 4(2x) = 8x gallons.
4. We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, so the small pool is losing water at a rate of 4x gallons/minute and the big pool is losing water at a rate of 8x gallons/minute.
5. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 4x - 8x = 0
6. Simplifying: 4x = 0
7. Solving for x: x = 0
Therefore, the small pool has 0 gallons of water now.</s>

2. Next, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. Since there are five numbers greater than 3 (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 5/6.

3. To find the percentage difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then divide by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6

1. First, we need to calculate how much cooling the air conditioner does in one hour:
- On low, it cools the room 2 degrees/hour
- On high, it cools the room 3 degrees/hour
- So in one hour, the air conditioner can cool the room 2 + 3 = 5 degrees

2. Next, we need to calculate how much heating the room does in one hour without the air conditioner:
- The room warms up at 2 degrees/hour
- So in one hour, the room warms up 2 degrees

3. Now we can calculate how much cooling the air conditioner does in total for 3 hours:
- On low, it cools the room 2 degrees/hour x 3 hours = 6 degrees
- On high, it cools the room 3 degrees/hour x 3 hours = 9 degrees
- So in total, the air conditioner cools the room 6 + 9 = 15 degrees

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 4 liters

So the boat is taking in 4 liters of water per second.

3. Since the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans in the jar is 100% + 1%(101%x) = 102%x.
4. We know that the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, so we can set up an equation: 

101%x + 102%x = 4500 

5. Simplifying the equation: 

203%x = 4500 

6. Solving for x: 

x = 4500/203 

x = 22 

Therefore, the jar contains 22 more green jelly beans than

3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.
A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.
Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?

Let's call the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks "x".
The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.
The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3(4x - 5) = 12x - 15.
The total number of people kicked out is 50, so we can set up an equation:
x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50
Simplifying this equation, we get:
19x - 10 = 50
Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

2. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So we can write an equation:
x + 10 = 9x
3. We also know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, which is equivalent to 96 inches. So we can substitute that into the equation:
x + 10 = 9(96)
4. Simplifying the equation:
x + 10 = 876

x = 876 - 10
x = 866

1. Let's start by assigning variables to each person's age:
- Let x be my age
- Let y be my brother's age
- Let z be my sister's age

From the problem, we know that:
- x = y - 3 (I am three years younger than my brother)
- x = y + 2 (I am two years older than my sister)
- z = 3y - 1 (my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

We also know that when we add all our ages, we get 87:
x + y + z = 87

Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
3(y - 3) + 2(y + 2) + 3y - 1 = 87

Simplifying this equation, we get:
3(y - 3) + 2(y + 2) + 3y - 1 = 87

3(y - 3) + 2(y + 2) + 3y = 87

x + 3x = 120,000
4. Simplifying this equation, we get:

1. First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. We know that she walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, so we can set up an equation:

2 miles / 40 minutes = 1 mile / x minutes

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20 minutes

So it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know that she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, so we can set up another equation:

2 miles / 40 minutes = 1 mile / y minutes

Solving for y, we get:

y = 20 minutes

So it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now we can find out how long it takes her to walk the entire 3 miles:

3 miles / x minutes = 3 miles / y minutes

50 km/hr = (50 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 16.67 m/s 

2. Next, we can use the formula: 

distance = speed x time 

distance = 6000 m 

time = distance / speed 

time = 6000 / 16.67 = 36.67 hours 

3. Now we can calculate the distance covered:

Paul's age = John's age + 10

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:

Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:

Peter's age = John's age + 10 + John's age

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Peter's age = 20 + John's age

We also know that the combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old:

Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

20 + John's age + John's age = 100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

5. Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box, while Martha has 7 chocolate bars in each box.
6. To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract 7 from 16: 16 - 7 = 9.

1. First, we need to find the weight of one candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as one candied apple, we can divide the weight of one chocolate bar by 2 to find the weight of one candied apple:

40g / 2 = 20g

So each candied apple weighs 20g.

2. Next, we can find the total weight of the chocolate bars by multiplying the weight of one chocolate bar by the number of chocolate bars:

40g x 25 = 1000g

3. Finally, we can find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the weight of one candied apple by the number of candied apples:

20g x 80 = 1600g

4. To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we can add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

3. And Dinar's score is 10 less than Azibo's score, so Dinar's score is x - 10.
4. We know that the team's total score is 45 points, so we can set up an equation:
x + (x + 20) + (x - 10) = 45
Simplifying this equation, we get:
3x - 10 = 45
Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

1. Let's call the number of eggs that Arnold painted "A" and the number of eggs that Madeline painted "M". 

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we can set up an equation: 

A + M = 30 

We also know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so we can add 12 to Sarah's number of eggs: 

M + 12 = 30 

Simplifying the equation: 

M = 18 

So Madeline painted 18 eggs. 

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can set up another equation: 

A = M 

Now we can substitute M = 18 into the first equation: 

A = 18 

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we can set up another equation: 

A + M = 30 

Substituting A = 18: 

18 + M = 30

1. Charlie needs 10 pounds of beeswax to make 10 tapered candles. Therefore, he needs 100 pounds of beeswax to make 100 tapered candles.
2. The cost of 10 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 100 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $100.00.
3. Charlie sells each tapered candle for $2.00. Therefore, his total revenue from selling 100 tapered candles is 200 x $2.00 = $400.00.
4. Charlie's net profit is his total revenue minus his total cost. Therefore, his net profit is $400.00 - $100.00 = $300.00.

Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $300.00.</s>

2. The second smallest angle is twice the size of the smallest angle, so it is 2x.
3. The largest angle is three times the size of the smallest angle, so it is 3x.
4. The sum of all three angles is 180 degrees, so we can write an equation:
x + 2x + 3x = 180
5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
6x = 180
6. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 6:

Dora's father's age = 30

So Dora's father is 30 years old.

Dora's mother's age = 26

So Dora's mother is 26 years old.

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's call the number of sheep "S" and the number of geese "G". 

2. We know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so we can set up an equation: 

S + G = 70 

3. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up another equation: 

S + G = 20 

4. Now we can use the first equation to solve for S: 

S + G = 70 

S = 70 - G 

5. We can substitute this into the second equation: 

S + G = 20 

S + (70 - G) = 20 

6. Simplifying: 

70 - G = 30 

G = 40 

7. Substituting G = 40 into the first equation: 

S + 40 = 70 

S = 30

1. First, we need to find out how big each kid's slice is. We can do this by dividing the total number of slices by the number of kids: 

6 slices ÷ 4 kids = 1.5 slices per kid 

So each kid gets a slice that is 1.5 slices long. 

2. Next, we need to find out how big each adult's slice is. We can do this by multiplying each kid's slice by 2: 

1.5 slices per kid x 2 = 3 slices per adult 

So each adult gets a slice that is 3 slices long.

1. First, we need to figure out how many trips the sloth needs to make to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. 

24 berries / 8 hours = 3 berries per hour 

3 berries per hour means the sloth needs to make 3 trips per hour to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. 

2. Next, we need to figure out how many berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's call the number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip "x". 

3 trips per hour means the sloth needs to make 3 trips per hour to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. 

3 trips per hour x 8 hours = 24 trips 

24 trips x x berries per trip = 24x 

24x = 24 berries 

x = 2 

So the sloth can pick up 2 berries per trip. 

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down

2. We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can set up an equation: L = D + 7

3. We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can set up another equation: D = (1/2)B

4. We know that the three of them found a total of 43 insects, so we can set up another equation: L + D + B = 43

5. Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation: L + (D + 7) + (1/2)B = 43

Lylah's salary = Adrien's salary + 30% of Adrien's salary
Lylah's salary = 30% of Adrien's salary + Adrien's salary
Lylah's salary = 0.30 * Adrien's salary + Adrien's salary
Lylah's salary = 0.30 * 40000 + 40000
Lylah's salary = 12600

So Lylah's salary four years ago was $12600.

1. Let's call the number of cows "C" and the number of chickens "Ch". 

We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so: 

Ch = 2C 

We also know that he has 60 animals, so: 

C + Ch = 60 

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 

(2C) + Ch = 60 

Simplifying: 

3C + Ch = 60 

Subtracting 3C from both sides: 

Ch = 57 

So Farmer Brown has 57 chickens. 

To find the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of chickens by 2 (since each chicken has 2 legs). 

57 x 2 = 114 

Therefore, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 114 legs.

2. We know that it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. We also know that it took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice to cook beans, which means it took x = 1/2(50 + 30) = 30 minutes to cook beans.
4. To find the total time it took to cook all the food, we add up the times for rice, pork, and beans: 30 + 50 + 30 = 110.
Therefore, it took Finley 110 minutes to cook all the food.</s>

1. First, we need to find Emma's age. Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can subtract Mia's age from Emma's age to find her age:
Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 - 16
Emma's age = 24

2. Now that we know Emma's age, we can find the average of their ages:
Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 24) / 2
Average age = 30

Therefore, the average of their ages is 30.</s>

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's say Sam's current age is "S" and Ruby's current age is "R". 

From the problem, we know that: 
- R = 6S (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam) 
- In 9 years, R = 3S (in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam) 

We can use the second equation to solve for S: 
S + 9 = 3(R) 
S + 9 = 27 
S = 18 

So Sam is currently 18 years old. 

To find Ruby's current age, we can substitute S = 18 into the first equation: 
R = 6(18) 
R = 108 

Therefore, Ruby is currently 108 years old.

6x = 120

x = 20

So the number of strawberry cubes is 20. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we can substitute x = 20 into the equation:
