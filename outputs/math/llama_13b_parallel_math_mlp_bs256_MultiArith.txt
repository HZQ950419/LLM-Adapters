To find out how many new books Sam bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought.

Total books = 13 + 17 = 30
Used books = 15

New books = Total books - Used books
New books = 30 - 15
New books = 15

Therefore, Sam bought 15 new books.</s>

Maria bought 2 new chairs and 2 new tables for her house. If she spent 8 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to finish?

To find the total time Maria spent putting together the furniture, we need to multiply the time spent on each piece by the number of pieces.

Time spent on each piece = 8 minutes
Number of pieces = 2 chairs + 2 tables = 4 pieces

Total time spent = Time spent on each piece x Number of pieces
Total time spent = 8 minutes x 4 pieces
Total time spent = 32 minutes

Therefore, it took Maria 32 minutes to finish putting together all the furniture.</s>

First, we need to find out how many problems Isabel has left to do. We know that she has 5 pages of problems left, and each page has the same number of problems on it. Let's call the number of problems on each page "x". 

So, the total number of problems Isabel has left to do is: 

5 pages x x problems per page = 5x 

We also know that Isabel started with 72 problems and finished 32 of them. So the number of problems she has left to do is: 

72 - 32 = 40 

Now we can set up an equation: 

5x = 40 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5: 

x = 8 

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.</s>

The first step is to find out how many bags Gwen did recycle. We can do this by subtracting the number of bags she didn't recycle from the total number of bags: 

4 bags - 2 bags = 2 bags 

So Gwen recycled 2 bags. 

Next, we can find out how many points she earned by multiplying the number of bags by the number of points per bag: 

2 bags x 8 points per bag = 16 points 

Therefore, Gwen would have earned 16 points if she recycled 2 out of the 4 bags. The answer in Arabic numerals is 16.</s>

To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who did make the cut from the total number of students who tried out.

Total number of students who tried out = 17 girls + 32 boys = 49

To do this, we can subtract the number of action figures John already has from the total number he needs: 

7 - 5 = 2 

So John needs 2 more action figures to complete his collection. 

Next, we can multiply the cost of each action figure by the number John needs:
