1. Find the area of the bathroom: 36 sq ft
2. Determine how much of the bathroom needs to be covered: 2/3 of 36 sq ft = 24 sq ft
3. Divide the area to be covered by the number of tiles needed per square foot: 24 sq ft ÷ 24 tiles/sq ft = 1 sq ft
4. Multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles needed per square foot: 1 sq ft x 24 tiles/sq ft = 24 tiles

Therefore, Mr Boarden would need 24 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. The answer in Arabic numerals is 24.</s>

1. Let's start by assigning variables to each person's age:
- Let x be the age of one of the twins.
- Let y be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let z be the age of the other triplet.

2. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write an equation:
x = y + 7

3. We also know that their combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:
x + y + z = 44

4. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
(x + y + z) = 44

5. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
3x + 3y + 3z = 44

6. Subtracting 3z from both sides, we get:
3x + 3y = 41

7. Subtracting 3y from both sides, we get:
3x = 38

8. Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

3. We also know that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can write:
S = 3P

4. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
B = S + 12 = 3P + 12

5. We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:
B + S + P = 341

6. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
3P + 12 = 341

7. Solving for P, we get:
P = 341 - 12 - 12

Jimmy's money = 2 x Ethel's money + $2

2. We know that Ethel has $8, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Jimmy's money = 2 x $8 + $2
Jimmy's money = $16 + $2
Jimmy's money = $18

Therefore, Jimmy is having $18.</s>

2. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the number of votes against it, so it is 2x.
3. We know that the total number of votes is 33, so we can set up an equation:
x + 2x = 33
4. Solving for x, we get:
3x = 33

We know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it makes (3/4) * 2 = 1.5 flights to Greece per day. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so the first plane makes (1/2) * 2 = 1 flight to each country per day. Therefore, the first plane makes a total of 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 flights per day.

2. Next, we need to find out how many flights the second plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland, so it makes 44 flights per day.

3. To find out how many flights to France the first plane makes in a day, we need to subtract the number of flights the second plane makes to Poland from the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day: 2.5 - 44 = 40.

Therefore, the first plane makes 40 flights to France per day.

Total green hat sales = $200 + $400
Total green hat sales = $600

4. We know that the total number of tennis balls he retrieved is 19, so we can set up an equation:
x + (x + 4) + (x + 4)/2 = 19
5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 4 = 19
6. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
3x = 15
7. Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 5

Therefore, Rory retrieved 5 tennis balls in the first set of the match.</s>

3. Matt also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room, so he can have 0.5x + 2 cookies.
4. Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we can set up an equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5.
5. Solving for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3.
6. Dividing both sides by 0.5, we get x = 6.

Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.</s>

- Let y be the cost of one action figure
- Let z be the cost of the doll

2. We know that one red car costs $4, so we can set up an equation:
x = 4

3. We also know that one action figure costs $5, so we can set up another equation:
y = 5

4. Finally, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so we can set up another equation:
z = 3y

5. Now we can substitute the values we have found into the equation for the doll's cost:
z = 3y
y = 5
z = 3(5)
z = 15

6. To find the total cost of all the toys, we can add up the cost of each type of toy:

2. We know that the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, so we can substitute that into the equation:

11 * speed of thingamabob = 121

3. Now we can solve for the speed of the thingamabob:

speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11

speed of thingamabob = 11

4. Finally, we can use the fact that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig:

speed of whirligig = 5 * speed of thingamabob

speed of whirligig = 5 * 11

So the Comet had orbited the sun 45 times since Bill's dad saw it.

2. Now we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time. We know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So we can set up an equation:

Bill's age when he saw the Comet = 3 x Bill's dad's age when he saw the Comet

We know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, so we can substitute that into the equation:

1. Let's start by finding the length of the yellow rope. We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can subtract 7 from the length of the yellow rope to find the length of the blue rope:

Yellow rope length = 37 - 7 = 30 centimeters
Blue rope length = 30 - 7 = 23 centimeters

2. We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can multiply the length of the blue rope by 4 to find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 x 23 = 92 centimeters

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 92 centimeters.</s>

We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so if we let x be the size of Zack's locker in cubic inches, then Peter's locker is 1/4x cubic inches. We also know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up an equation:

1/4x = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20

So Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Corns = 2 * Cannolis
Corns = 2 * 40
Corns = 80

2. We also know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so:

Cannolis = 40 + 60
Cannolis = 100

3. Now we can find the total number of cannolis and corns Allan has in his house:

Total = Cannolis + Corns
Total = 100 + 80
Total = 180

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 180.</s>

2. Now let's find out how much time Dana spends running and walking. We know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, so she spends:

1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours running
2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours walking

3. Now let's find out how far Dana can travel in 6 hours. We know that she can skip at a rate of speed of 3 miles per hour, and she spends 2 hours skipping, so she travels:

2 hours * 3 miles/hour = 6 miles skipping

12 pints ÷ 3 = 4 pints

This means that 4 pints of paint were used for the red, white, and purple parts of the mural.

2. We also know that half the mural is yellow, so we can divide the total amount of paint used by 2:

12 pints ÷ 2 = 6 pints

This means that 6 pints of paint were used for the yellow part of the mural.

3. To find out how much paint was used for the red part of the mural, we can subtract the amount of paint used for the yellow part from the total amount of paint used:

12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints

Therefore, 6 pints of paint were used for the red part of the mural.

2. We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so we can set up another equation:

Colin's age in 25 years = 1/3 x Wendy's age

3. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for Colin's current age:

Colin's age in 25 years = 1/3 x (Wendy's age)

Colin's age in 25 years = 1/3 x (Wendy's age in 25 years)

2/3 x 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, the dog can eat the same number of sausages in 20 minutes.

2. Now we can calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:

Average time = (time taken by cat + time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

1. Let's start by finding out how far Vanessa was able to run. We know that Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did, so if Aaron ran 4 miles, then Vanessa ran 4 x 2 = 8 miles.

2. Next, we need to find out how long it took Aaron to complete his part of the race. We know that Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so it took him 16/2 = 8 minutes to complete his part of the race.

3. Now we can find out how long it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race. We know that Vanessa ran 8 miles, and it took her 8 x 2 = 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Therefore, it took Vanessa 16 minutes to complete her part of the race. The answer in Arabic numerals is 16.</s>

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago

2. We also know that Duncan's age 8 years ago was 60, so we can substitute that into the equation:

60 = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago

3. Now we can solve for Adam's age 4 years ago by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

Adam's age 4 years ago = 30

4. Finally, we can find Adam's age in 8 years by adding 8 to his age 4 years ago:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's age 4 years ago + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

2. The problem tells us that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. We can write this as:
5x - 4 = number of blueberry cubes
3. We also know that the total number of ice cubes Mary makes is 116. So we can set up an equation:
x + (5x - 4) = 116
4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
6x - 4 = 116
5. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
6x = 112
6. Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
x = 18

1. Tobias howls for a total of 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.
4. To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we add the lengths of time for each howl: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.
5. To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.</s>

1. Let's start by finding out how many cookies Cody eats. We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats, so:

Cody = 3 * Amir
Cody = 3 * 5
Cody = 15

So Cody eats 15 cookies.

2. To find out how many cookies both of them eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats:

Together = Amir + Cody
Together = 5 + 15
Together = 20

Therefore, both of them eat 20 cookies together.</s>

1. Let x be the cost of each additional phone.
2. The cost of the main phone is twice as much as each additional phone, so the cost of the main phone is 2x.
3. The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones, so we can write:
Total cost = 2x + 5x = 7x
4. We know that the total cost of the phone plan is $20, so we can set up an equation:
7x = 20
5. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 7:
x = 3
6. Therefore, the cost of each additional phone is 3 dollars, and the cost of the main phone is 6 dollars (2x = 2(3) = 6). The total cost of the phone plan is 7x = 7(3) = 21 dollars.

Answer: The whole phone plan costs 21 dollars.</s>

1 dozen = 12 eggs
3 dozen = 3 x 12 = 36 eggs

Lamar finds 5 eggs, so there are 36 - 5 = 31 eggs still hidden in the yard.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so she finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so he finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so she finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Therefore, there are 31 - 5 - 10 - 2 - 4 = 4 eggs still hidden in the yard.
