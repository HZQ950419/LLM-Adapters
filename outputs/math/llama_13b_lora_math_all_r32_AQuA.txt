1. First, we need to find the volume of the rectangular solid:
Volume = length x width x height
Volume = 3 x 4 x 15
Volume = 108 cubic units

2. Next, we need to find the surface area of the rectangular solid:
Surface area = 2(length + width + height)
Surface area = 2(3 + 4 + 15)
Surface area = 2(22)
Surface area = 44 square units

3. Since the rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the surface area of the rectangular solid is also the surface area of the sphere. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is:
Diameter = 2 x Surface area
Diameter = 2 x 44
Diameter = 88

2. Next, we need to find the tens digit of M and N. We know that M > N, so the tens digit of M must be greater than the tens digit of N. We also know that M - N + 396c = 990, so we can set up an equation:

10a - 10b + 396c = 990

3. Solving for the tens digit of M, we get:

10a - 10b = 604

4. Subtracting 10b from both sides, we get:

9a = 604

5. Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

1. First, we need to find the total number of coins in the pouch. Since there are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins, we can use the formula:

Total number of coins = (Number of 25 paise coins x 25) + (Number of 50 paise coins x 50) + (Number of one rupee coins x 1)

2. Substituting the given values, we get:

Total number of coins = (Number of 25 paise coins x 25) + (Number of 50 paise coins x 50) + (Number of one rupee coins x 1)
Total number of coins = (25 x 25) + (50 x 50) + (1 x 1)
Total number of coins = 625 + 250 + 1
Total number of coins = 926

Let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and (18-x) brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. Therefore, the cost of each white sharpeners is Rs. 10 + 1 = Rs. 11 and the cost of each brown sharpeners is Rs. 10.

So, the total cost of x white sharpeners is 11x and the total cost of (18-x) brown sharpeners is 10(18-x).

The total cost of all the sharpeners is 11x + 10(18-x) = Rs. 100.

Let the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person be x.

Then, the bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh is (4/3)x.

According to the problem, the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512.

So, 6(4/3)x + 8x = 1512

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

4x + 8x = 1512

12x = 1512

x = 126

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 126.</s>

1. Let's call the length of the longer piece of rope "x" and the length of the shorter piece of rope "y".
2. We know that the total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we can write an equation: x + y = 20
3. We also know that the length of the shorter piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the longer piece, so we can write another equation: y = x - 3
4. Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: x + (x - 3) = 20
5. Simplifying the equation: 2x - 3 = 20
6. Adding 3 to both sides: 2x = 23
7. Dividing both sides by 2: x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.</s>

1. First, we need to convert the rate of the liquid passing through the drain from gallons per second to gallons per minute. We can do this by dividing the rate by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

w/25 gallons every x seconds ÷ 60 = w/x gallons every minute 

2. Now we can use this rate to find how long it will take y gallons to pass through the drain. We can set up a proportion: 

w/x = y/z 

where z is the number of minutes it takes y gallons to pass through the drain. 

3. Solving for x: 

w/x = y/z 

y/z = w/x 

x = y/w 

4. Substituting this value of x into the rate of the liquid passing through the drain: 

w/x = w/y/w 

w/x = 1 

x = 1 

Therefore, it will take 1 minute for y gallons to pass through

Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins from the bottom of the river.

According to the problem, the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.

So, the diver's total earnings from the copper coins can be calculated as:

20x

And the total earnings from the brass coins can be calculated as:

25y

The total earnings from the dive can be calculated as:

20x + 25y = $3.40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20x + 25y = 3.4

Subtracting 25y from both sides, we get:

20x = 1.4

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 0.7

Therefore, the diver brought 7 copper coins from the bottom of the river.

The minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 7.

Original Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + 60% of Wholesale Cost

60% of Wholesale Cost = 0.6 * Wholesale Cost

Original Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + 0.6 * Wholesale Cost

Original Retail Price = 1.6 * Wholesale Cost

2. We also know that the appliance was actually sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so we can set up another equation:

Sale Price = Original Retail Price - 20% of Original Retail Price

Sale Price = 1.6 * Wholesale Cost - 0.2 * 1.6 * Wholesale Cost

Sale Price = 1.6 * Wholesale Cost - 0.32 * Wholesale Cost

1. Let x be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
2. Let y be the number of water lilies on the lake after x days.
3. We know that the number of water lilies on the lake doubles every two days. Therefore, after x days, the number of water lilies on the lake will be 2^x.
4. We also know that initially there was exactly one water lily on the lake. Therefore, after x days, the total number of water lilies on the lake will be 2^x + 1.
5. We are given that if there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. Therefore, after 60 days, the total number of water lilies on the lake will be 2^60 + 1.

1. Let's first find the distance traveled by the ship in miles.
Since the ship traveled 180 miles, the distance traveled by the plane will be 10 times the distance traveled by the ship.
So, the distance traveled by the plane will be 10 x 180 = 1800 miles.

2. Let's find the total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane.
Total distance = distance traveled by ship + distance traveled by plane
Total distance = 180 + 1800
Total distance = 1980 miles

Therefore, the distance when they meet from starting point will be 1980 miles.</s>

1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, so 20 kilometers is equal to 20,000 meters and 6 kilometers is equal to 6,000 meters.

The distance from home to work is 20,000 meters, and it takes 9 minutes to drive it at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. Therefore, the time it takes to drive the distance is:

20,000 meters / 20 kilometers per hour = 1,000 seconds = 16.67 minutes

To cycle the same distance at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour, we can use the formula:

1. Let's call the number we're trying to find "x".
2. We know that 3/4 of x is equal to 21, so we can set up an equation: 3/4x = 21
3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3: 3/4x * 4/3 = 21 * 4/3
4. Simplifying the right side of the equation: 12 = 21 * 4/3
5. Multiplying both sides by 3/4: 12 * 3/4 = 21

Let's assume that R's age is x and T's age is y.

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, Q's age can be represented as x - y.

The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, we can write an equation:

x + (x - y) = 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - y = 50

Adding y to both sides, we get:

2x = 50 + y

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 25

So, R's age is 25 years and T's age is 25 years.

Now, we can find Q's age using the given information:

Q's age = R's age - T's age

Q's age = 25 - 25

Q's age = 0

Therefore, Q's age is 0 years.

1 mile is equal to 5,280 feet.

Let's assume that Janice bikes for x minutes and Jennie bikes for y minutes.

Distance covered by Janice = 10x feet
Distance covered by Jennie = 20y feet

Total distance covered = 10x + 20y feet

We know that 1 mile = 5,280 feet, so we can set up an equation:

10x + 20y = 5280

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5280/10 - 20y

Now we can substitute this expression for x into the equation for distance covered by Janice:

Distance covered by Janice = 10(5280/10 - 20y) feet

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Distance covered by Janice = 2640 - 20y feet

Now we can substitute this expression for distance covered by Janice into the equation for total distance covered:

Let's call the tens digit "x" and the units digit "y". 

According to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can write an equation: 

10x + y = (10x + y) + 18 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

10x + y = 28 

We also know that the units digit is double the tens digit, so: 

y = 2x 

Substituting this into our equation, we get: 

10x + 2x = 28 

Combining like terms, we get: 

12x = 28 

Dividing both sides by 12, we get: 

x = 2 

Now that we know x is 2, we can find y by substituting x = 2 into our original equation:

1. Let's assume that the cost of repairing the current tires for one year is $40. Therefore, the cost of repairing the current tires for four years will be $40 x 4 = $<<40*4=160>>160.

2. The cost of purchasing new tires for four years is $180 x 4 = $<<180*4=720>>720.

3. The average cost per year of the new tires is $720/4 = $<<720/4=180>>180 per year.

4. The average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $160 per year.

5. The difference between the average cost per year of the new tires and the average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $180 - $160 = $<<180-160=20>>20.

6. Therefore, the cost of purchasing new tires for four years is 20% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires

1. Let the rate of interest be x% per annum.

2. Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

3. Compound Interest (CI) = P * (1 + R/100)^T, where T is the time period.

4. The difference between SI and CI is given as Rs. 72.

5. Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

72 = (5000 * x * 2) / 100 - (5000 * (1 + x/100)^2) / 100

6. Simplifying the above equation, we get:

72 = (1000 * x) - (5000 * (1 + x/100)^2) / 100

To find the value of log2 4, we can use the fact that log2 x is equal to the number of times we need to multiply 2 by itself to get x. 

So, log2 4 is equal to the number of times we need to multiply 2 by itself to get 4. 

We can write this as: 

log2 4 = 2^n, where n is the number of times we need to multiply 2 by itself to get 4. 

Now, we can use the fact that 2^3 = 8 and 2^2 = 4 to find the value of n. 

n = log2 8 - log2 4 

n = 3 - 2 

n = 1 

Therefore, log2 4 = 2^1 = 2.

1. Let the height of the tree be x metres.
2. We know that the height of the electric pole is 14 metres and its shadow is 10 metres. Therefore, the height of the tree must be greater than 14 metres to cast a shadow of 15 metres.
3. Let's assume that the height of the tree is y metres.
4. We know that the ratio of the height of the tree to its shadow is the same as the ratio of the height of the electric pole to its shadow.
5. Therefore, we have:

y/15 = 14/10

6. Multiplying both sides by 10, we get:

y = 140

1. Let x be the original price of the item.
2. The discounted price is x - 0.22x = 0.78x.
3. The customer bought the item at the discounted price and used a $20-off coupon, so the final price is 0.78x - 20 = 0.58x.
4. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can set up an equation: 0.58x + 1.90 = 0.5x + x.
5. Solving for x, we get: 0.58x = 0.5x + 1.90.
6. Subtracting 0.5x from both sides, we get: 0.58x - 0.5x = 1.90.

To find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the total number of pairs of relatively prime numbers less than 1,000 and divide it by the total number of pairs of integers less than 1,000.

First, we need to find the total number of pairs of relatively prime numbers less than 1,000. We can do this by finding the total number of pairs of integers less than 1,000 and then subtracting the pairs that are not relatively prime.

Total number of pairs of integers less than 1,000 = 1,000 x 999/2 = 499,500

Pairs of integers that are not relatively prime = 1,000 x 999/2 = 499,500

Total number of pairs of relatively prime numbers less than 1,000 = 499,500 - 499,500 = 0

The formula for simple interest is:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Where,
Principal = Rs. 5000
Rate = ?
Time = 3 years

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:

300 = (5000 × Rate × 3) / 100

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

300 = 15000R

Dividing both sides by 15000, we get:

Rate = 2%

Therefore, the answer is option A) 2%.</s>

1. Let's assume that the population of Boomtown one year ago was 100.
2. According to the problem, the population of Boomtown two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, the population two years from now would be 100 x 2 = 200.
3. The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So, the population of Boomtown after one year would be 100 + 10% of 100 = 110.
4. The population of Boomtown after two years would be 200.
5. The difference between the population of Boomtown after two years and the population of Boomtown after one year would be 200 - 110 = 90.
6. The percent increase in the population of Boomtown over the last year would be (90/100) x 100% = 90%.

1. Calculate the total production cost for the year: 

420 units/month x 12 months/year = 5040 units/year 

5040 units x $110/unit = $554,400 

2. Calculate the revenue from selling all 5040 units: 

5040 units x $x/unit = $504,000 

3. Subtract the production cost from the revenue to find the yearly profit: 

$504,000 - $554,400 = -$50,400 

4. Since we want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, the minimum selling price per component must be: 

$50,400 / 5040 units = $10/unit 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 226.</s>

1. Let's assume that Alex has worked for x hours and Jacob has worked for y hours.
2. We know that Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy.
3. Therefore, the total time taken by both of them to make 35 toys is:
x + y = 35
4. Solving for y, we get:
y = 35 - x
5. We also know that both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours.
6. Let's assume that the difference between the number of hours worked by Alex and Jacob is k.
7. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by both of them is:
x + k + y = 35 + k
8. Substituting the value of y from step 4, we get:
x + k + (35 - x) = 35 + k
9. Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + k = 70 + k
10. Subtracting k from both sides, we get:

Let's call the number of times the coin landed on heads "H" and the number of times it landed on tails "T". 

We know that H + T = 20 (since there were 20 flips). 

We also know that if the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, and if it lands on tails, Jonathan gives 3$ to Christopher. 

So we can set up an equation: 

2(H) + 3(T) = 0 

Simplifying this equation: 

2H + 3T = 0 

Subtracting 3T from both sides: 

2H = -3T 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

H = -T 

So the number of times the coin landed on heads is equal to the number of times it landed on tails. 

We know that H + T = 20, so: 

-T + T = 20
