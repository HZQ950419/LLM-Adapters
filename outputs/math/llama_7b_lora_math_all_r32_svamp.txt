1. Let's start by finding out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can set up an equation:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56
38 = Zachary's push-ups + 56

2. Now we can solve for Zachary's push-ups:

Zachary's push-ups = 38 - 56
Zachary's push-ups = -18

So Zachary did -18 push-ups.

3. To find out how many push-ups David and Zachary did altogether, we can add their individual totals:

Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups
Total push-ups = 38 + (-18)
Total push-ups = 56

Therefore, David and Zachary did a total of 56 push-ups altogether.</s>

1. Let's start by assigning a variable to represent the number of push-ups Zachary did. Let's call it "x".
2. We know that David did 30 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write an equation:
David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 30
3. We also know that David did 37 push-ups, so we can substitute that into the equation:
37 = x + 30
4. Now we can solve for x by subtracting 30 from both sides:
x = 37 - 30
x = 7
5. Therefore, Zachary did 7 push-ups.

Answer: Zachary did 7 push-ups.</s>

- David did 44 push-ups.
- David did 9 more push-ups than Zachary.

2. Use algebra to solve for the number of push-ups Zachary did.
- Let x be the number of push-ups Zachary did.
- We know that David did 9 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did x + 9 push-ups.
- We also know that David did 44 push-ups, so we can set up the equation: x + 9 = 44.

3. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.
- Subtract 9 from both sides: x + 9 - 9 = 44 - 9

1. First, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 18 peaches. So, Jake has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.
2. Next, we need to find out how many apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, who has 11 apples. So, Jake has 11 + 10 = 21 apples.
3. To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we subtract the number of apples from the number of peaches: 18 - 21 = -3.

Therefore, Steven has -3 more peaches than apples. The answer in Arabic numerals is -3.</s>
