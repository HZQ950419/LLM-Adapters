1. Let's call the number of grams of strawberry jelly "x".
2. We know that the total amount of jelly they have is 6310 grams.
3. We also know that they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly.
4. So we can set up an equation: 

x + 4518 = 6310 

5. Solving for x: 

x = 6310 - 4518 

6. Simplifying: 

x = 1792 

Therefore, Shannon and her family have 1792 grams of strawberry jelly.</s>
