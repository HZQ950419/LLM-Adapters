1. Find the total number of crackers and cakes Matthew had initially: 

32 crackers + 98 cakes = 130 treats 

2. Divide the total number of treats by the number of friends: 

130 treats รท 4 friends = 35 treats per friend 

3. Multiply the number of treats per friend by the number of crackers each friend ate: 

35 treats per friend x 4 crackers = 140 crackers 

Therefore, each person ate 140 crackers.

2. Jason had 22 dollars last week.
3. They washed cars over the weekend and now Fred has 21 dollars and Jason has 78 dollars.
4. To find out how much money Jason made over the weekend, we need to subtract his current amount from his starting amount:

1. Debby bought 301 water bottles when they were on sale.
2. If she drank 144 bottles a day for some days, then she drank a total of 144 x N days, where N is the number of days she drank.
3. If she has 157 bottles left, then she drank a total of 301 - 157 = 144 bottles.
4. To find the number of days she drank, we need to divide the total number of bottles she drank by the number of bottles she drank per day: 144 รท 144 = 1.
5. Therefore, Debby drank for 1 day.

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let x be the number of marbles Doug had initially.
2. We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 19 marbles.
3. Ed lost some marbles at the playground, so he now has x + 8 marbles.
4. We also know that Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up an equation: x + 8 = 19.
5. Solving for x, we get x = 11.
6. Therefore, Doug had 11 marbles initially, and Ed lost 19 - 11 = 8 marbles at the playground.

2. We know that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug, so Ed's initial number of marbles was D + 12.
3. Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground, so his current number of marbles is D - 20.
4. We also know that Ed currently has 17 marbles, so we can set up an equation:
D - 20 = 17
5. Solving for D, we can add 20 to both sides:
D - 20 + 20 = 17 + 20
D = 37

Ed's marbles after losing 21 = 91 - 21
Ed's marbles after losing 21 = 70

So Ed had 70 marbles after losing 21 of them.

3. Now we can find out how many marbles Ed had before losing 21 of them. We know that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, so:

1. Let's call the number of boys "B". 
2. We know that there are 700 girls, so we can set up an equation: 

B + 700 = 700 

3. We also know that there are 142 more boys than girls, so we can add 142 to both sides: 

B + 700 + 142 = 700 + 142 

4. Simplifying: 

B = 558 

So there are 558 boys in the school. 

5. To find the total number of pupils, we can add the number of girls and boys: 

700 + 558 = 1258 

Therefore, there are 1258 pupils in that school.</s>

1. Let's call the number of boys "B".
2. We know that there are 458 more girls than boys, so the number of boys is B - 458.
3. We also know that there are 692 girls, so we can set up an equation:
B - 458 = 692
4. Solving for B, we get:
B = 692 - 458
B = 234
5. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.
6. To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys and girls:
Total = B + 692
Total = 234 + 692

Area = length x width
Area = 11 feet x 15 feet
Area = 165 square feet

2. Since Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, we need to subtract that from the total area of the room:
Total area - 16 square feet of carpet = 165 square feet - 16 square feet
Total area - 16 square feet of carpet = 150 square feet

1. Dan has $4.
2. He bought 10 candy bars, each one costing the same amount of money. Let's call the cost of one candy bar "x".
3. So the total cost of 10 candy bars is 10x.
4. We know that Dan has $4, so we can set up an equation:
10x = 4
5. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 10:
x = 0.4
6. Therefore, each candy bar costs $0.4.
7. To find out how much money Dan has left, we subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the amount he started with:
$4 - 10x = $0
8. Simplifying, we get:
$4 - 10x = 0
9. Solving for x again, we divide both sides by 10:
x = 0
10. Therefore, each candy bar costs $0.
