1. Let x be the number of Pokemon cards Jason had to start with.
2. Jason gave 9 cards to his friends, so he has x - 9 cards left.
3. We know that Jason now has 4 cards left, so we can set up the equation:
x - 9 = 4
4. Solving for x, we can add 9 to both sides:
x - 9 + 9 = 4 + 9
x = 13

Therefore, Jason had 13 Pokemon cards to start with.</s>
