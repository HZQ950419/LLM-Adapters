1. We are given that Sam bought 13 adventure books and 17 mystery books.
2. We are also given that 15 of the books were used.
3. To find out how many new books Sam bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought.
4. Step 3 can be written as: New books = Total books - Used books
5. Substituting the given values, we get: New books = 13 + 17 - 15
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: New books = 1 + 6
7. Solving for New books, we get: New books = 7
8. Therefore, Sam bought 7 new books at the book fair.

Answer: Sam bought 7 new books. (7) (Arabic numerals)</s>

1. Bianca started with 52 seeds.
2. She planted 40 seeds in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 2 seeds each.
3. To find the number of small gardens, we need to subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds.
4. Total number of seeds = 52 - 40 = 12
5. Number of small gardens = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds planted in the big garden
6. Number of small gardens = 12 / 2 = 6

Therefore, Bianca had 6 small gardens.

To find out how many minutes it took Maria to finish putting the furniture together, we need to multiply the number of pieces of furniture she bought by the time it took her to put each piece together.

Maria bought 2 new chairs and 2 new tables, so the total number of pieces of furniture she bought is 2 + 2 = 4 pieces of furniture.

Maria spent 8 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, so the total time she spent putting the furniture together is 4 x 8 = 32 minutes.

To find out how many minutes it took Maria to finish putting the furniture together, we need to subtract the time it took her to buy the furniture from the total time she spent putting the furniture together.

32 - 8 = 24 minutes

Therefore, it took Maria 24 minutes to finish putting the furniture together.

Let x be the number of hours it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows. 

We know that the builder has already installed 6 windows, so we can set up an equation: 

6 + x = 10 

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides: 

x = 4 

So it will take the builder 4 hours to install the rest of the windows.

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of hours it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows. 

We know that the builder has already installed 6 windows, so we can set up an equation: 

6 + x = 9 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides: 

6 + x - 6 = 9 - 6 

Simplifying: 

x - 6 = 3 

Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 6: 

x = 3 

Therefore, it will take the builder 3 hours to install the rest of the windows.

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of hours it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows. 

We know that the builder has already installed 5 windows, so we can set up an equation: 

5 + x = 14 

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides: 

5 + x - 5 = 14 - 5 

Simplifying: 

x = 9 

Therefore, it will take the builder 9 hours to install the rest of the windows.

The painter needs to paint 6 rooms in a building. Each room takes 5 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?

First, we need to find out how many rooms the painter still needs to paint:
6 rooms - 2 rooms = 4 rooms

Next, we need to find out how long it will take the painter to paint the remaining 4 rooms:
4 rooms x 5 hours per room = 20 hours

Therefore, the painter will take 20 hours longer to paint the remaining 4 rooms. The total time it will take to paint all 6 rooms is:
2 rooms x 5 hours per room = 10 hours
6 rooms x 5 hours per room = 30 hours
30 hours + 20 hours = 50 hours

Answer: The painter will take 50 hours longer to

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of hours it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows. 

We know that the builder has already installed 8 windows, so we can set up an equation: 

8 + x = 14 

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides: 

8 + x - 8 = 14 - 8 

Simplifying: 

x = 6 

Therefore, it will take the builder 6 hours to install the rest of the windows.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many points you would earn if you destroy all but 3 enemies. 

First, we need to find out how many points you would earn if you destroy all 11 enemies. 

To do this, we can multiply the number of enemies by the number of points earned per enemy: 

11 enemies x 9 points per enemy = 99 points 

So, if you destroy all 11 enemies, you would earn 99 points. 

Next, we need to find out how many points you would earn if you destroy all but 3 enemies. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of enemies you destroy from the total number of enemies: 

11 enemies - 3 enemies = 8 enemies 

So, if you destroy all but 3 enemies, you would earn 8 points.

2. He has already installed 4 windows. 
3. It takes 8 hours to install each window. 

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows, we need to subtract the time he has already spent from the total time it will take to install all 11 windows. 

Total time = 11 windows x 8 hours per window = 88 hours 

Time spent so far = 4 windows x 8 hours per window = 32 hours 

Time left = Total time - Time spent so far = 88 hours - 32 hours = 56 hours

To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

Total number of players = 31 new players + 4 returning players = 35 players
Number of players in each group = 7 players

To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:

35 players ÷ 7 players/group = 5 groups

Therefore, there would be 5 groups with 7 players in each group. The answer in Arabic numerals is 5.</s>

The painter needs to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?

First, we need to find out how many rooms are left to paint:
12 total rooms - 5 rooms already painted = 7 rooms left to paint

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to paint those 7 rooms:
7 rooms x 7 hours per room = 49 hours

Finally, we need to find out how much longer it will take to paint the remaining 7 rooms:
49 hours - 5 rooms already painted = 44 hours

Therefore, the painter will take 44 more hours to paint the remaining 7 rooms. The answer in Arabic numerals is 44.</s>

The painter needs to paint 11 rooms. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?

First, we need to find out how many rooms the painter has left to paint: 

11 rooms - 2 rooms = 9 rooms 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take the painter to paint the remaining 9 rooms: 

9 rooms x 7 hours per room = 63 hours 

Finally, we need to find out how much longer it will take the painter to paint the remaining 9 rooms: 

63 hours - 2 rooms x 7 hours per room = 51 hours 

Therefore, the painter will take 51 hours longer to paint the remaining 9 rooms.

The painter needs to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 3 hours to paint. If he already painted 4 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?

First, we need to find out how many rooms are left to paint:
12 rooms - 4 rooms = 8 rooms

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to paint the remaining 8 rooms:
8 rooms x 3 hours per room = 24 hours

Therefore, the painter will take 24 hours longer to paint the remaining 8 rooms. The total time it will take to paint all 12 rooms is:
3 hours per room x 12 rooms = 36 hours

36 hours + 24 hours = 60 hours

Therefore, the painter will take 60 hours longer to paint the remaining 8 rooms. The total time it will
