And the one after that would be x + 4. 

We know that the sum of these three consecutive even numbers is 162: 

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 162 

Simplifying this equation: 

3x + 6 = 162

1. Let's assume that Chris had x amount of money before his birthday.
2. According to the problem, Chris received $25 from his grandmother, $20 from his aunt and uncle, and $75 from his parents.
3. Therefore, the total amount of money Chris received on his birthday is $25 + $20 + $75 = $100.
4. To find out how much money Chris had before his birthday, we need to subtract the total amount of money he received on his birthday from the amount he has now: $279 - $100 = $179.
5. Therefore, Chris had $179 before his birthday.

1. Let's represent the number of blue marbles Tim has with the variable "x".
2. We know that Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim, so we can write an equation: 110 = 22x.
3. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 22: x = 5.
4. Therefore, Tim has 5 blue marbles.

Let's assume that Jason had x number of Pokemon cards to start with.

According to the problem, Jason gave 9 cards to his friends, so he would have had x - 9 cards left.

But the problem also tells us that Jason now has 4 cards left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 9 = 4

To solve for x, we can add 9 to both sides of the equation:

x - 9 + 9 = 4 + 9

Simplifying the left side:

x = 13

Therefore, Jason had 13 Pokemon cards to start with.</s>
