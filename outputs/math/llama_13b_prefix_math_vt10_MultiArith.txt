1. Find the total number of books Sam bought: 
13 + 17 = 30 books 

2. Subtract the number of used books from the total number of books: 
30 - 15 = 15 new books 

Therefore, Sam bought 15 new books at the book fair. 

Steps: 
1. Total number of books = 13 + 17 = 30 
2. Number of used books = 15 
3. Number of new books = Total number of books - Number of used books 
4. Number of new books = 30 - 15 = 15 
5. Sam bought 15 new books at the book fair. 

Answer: Sam bought 15 new books at the book fair. (15)</s>

1. Start with the total number of seeds Bianca had: 52
2. Divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds Bianca planted in each small garden: 52 ÷ 2 = 26
3. Subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds: 52 - 40 = 12
4. Divide the remaining seeds by the number of small gardens: 12 ÷ 26 = 0.46
5. Round up to the nearest whole number since Bianca can't have a fraction of a small garden: 0.46 rounds up to 1

Therefore, Bianca had 1 small garden.</s>

1. First, we need to find out how many customers left a tip by subtracting the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers: 

10 customers - 5 customers who didn't leave a tip = 5 customers who left a tip 

2. Next, we need to find out how much money each customer who left a tip gave by multiplying the number of customers who left a tip by the amount of money they gave: 

5 customers who left a tip x $3 per customer = $15 

3. Finally, we add the amount of money the waiter earned from the customers who left a tip to the amount of money he earned from the customers who didn't leave a tip to find the total amount of money he earned: 

$15 + ($10 x 5) = $40

2. We know that Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each, so the total points scored by everyone else is 2 x (number of players - 1) = 2 x 5 = 10.
3. We also know that the team scored a total of 39 points, so we can set up an equation: x + 23 + 10 = 39
4. Simplifying the equation, we get x + 33 = 39

2. On Sunday, Sam filled up 3 more bags with 6 cans in each bag, so he picked up 3 x 6 = 18 cans.
3. To find the total number of cans picked up, we add the number of cans picked up on Saturday to the number of cans picked up on Sunday: 24 + 18 = 42.

Therefore, Sam picked up a total of 42 cans.</s>

- The painter already painted 8 rooms.

2. Use the given information to set up an equation:
- Let x be the number of rooms the painter still needs to paint.
- We know that the painter already painted 8 rooms, so x = 10 - 8 = 2 rooms.

3. Use the equation to solve for the time it will take the painter to paint the remaining 2 rooms:
- Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the painter will need 2 x 8 = 16 hours to paint the remaining 2 rooms.

Therefore, the painter will take 16 hours longer to paint the remaining 2 rooms. The answer in Arabic numerals is 16.</s>

1. First, we need to find out how many albums Megan bought in total. Since she bought 2 country albums and 8 pop albums, we can add: 

2 + 8 = 10 

2. Next, we need to find out how many songs were on each album. Since each album had 7 songs, we can multiply the number of albums by 7: 

10 x 7 = 70 

3. Finally, we can add up the total number of songs Megan bought: 

2 x 7 = 14 (for the 2 country albums) 

8 x 7 = 56 (for the 8 pop albums) 

14 + 56 = 70

1. Sarah started with 21 seeds.
2. She planted 12 seeds in the big garden.
3. She planted 3 seeds in each of her small gardens, so she had a total of 3 small gardens.
4. To find the total number of seeds planted, we add the number of seeds planted in the big garden and the number of seeds planted in the small gardens: 12 + 3 x 3 = 18.
5. Therefore, Sarah planted a total of 18 seeds.
6. Since she started with 21 seeds, we can subtract the total number of seeds planted to find the number of seeds left: 21 - 18 = 3.

Monday: 3 hours 
Tuesday: 5 hours 
Total hours worked: 3 + 5 = 8 hours 

2. Calculate Edward's earnings per hour: 

Earnings per hour = 6 dollars 

3. Multiply the earnings per hour by the total number of hours worked to find Edward's total earnings: 

Total earnings = Earnings per hour x Total hours worked 
Total earnings = 6 dollars/hour x 8 hours 
Total earnings = 48 dollars 

Therefore, Edward made 48 dollars in those two days. The answer in Arabic numerals is 48.</s>

Zoe bought 3 country albums and 5 pop albums. 

So the total number of albums Zoe bought is: 

3 + 5 = 8 

2. Next, we need to find out how many songs are on each album. 

Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 3 songs. 

So the total number of songs on each album is: 

3 

3. Finally, we can find the total number of songs Zoe bought by multiplying the number of albums by the number of songs on each album.

1. Carol made 30 cupcakes.
2. She sold 9 cupcakes.
3. To find out how many cupcakes she has left, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes she sold from the total number of cupcakes she made: 

30 - 9 = 21 

4. Carol now has 21 cupcakes left. 

5. She then made 28 more cupcakes. 

6. To find out how many cupcakes she has altogether, we need to add the number of cupcakes she has left to the number of cupcakes she made after selling some: 

21 + 28 = 49

1. First, we need to find out how much one deck costs: 

$6/deck 

2. Next, we need to find out how many decks Edward bought: 

3 decks 

3. Now we can find out how much Edward spent on decks: 

$6/deck x 3 decks = $18 

4. Next, we need to find out how many decks Edward's friend bought: 

6 decks 

5. Now we can find out how much Edward's friend spent on decks: 

$6/deck x 6 decks = $36 

6. Finally, we can find out how much they spent in total by adding Edward's and his friend's expenses: 

$18 + $36 = $54 

Therefore, they spent $5
