1. We know that there is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. Therefore, the probability that exactly four of the five registered voters voted in the last election is:

P(exactly 4 voted) = 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 0.045

2. Since we are dealing with a binomial distribution, we can use the formula:

P(exactly 4 voted) = (n choose 4) x p^4 x (1 - p)^(n - 4)

where n is the number of trials (in this case, n = 5), p is the probability of success (in this case, p = 0.9), and (1 - p) is the probability of failure (in this case, (1 - p) = 0.1).

1. Let the train fare for one person be x.
2. According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. So, the bus fare for two persons is 4/3x.
3. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. So, we can write the equation:
4. 4/3x + 8x = 1512
5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
6. 12x = 1512
7. Dividing both sides by 12, we get:

2. Next, we need to find the distance between each pair of pickets. Since there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, the distance between each pair of pickets is 6 inches.

3. To find the length of the fence, we need to multiply the width of the fence by the distance between each pair of pickets. So, the length of the fence is 3 inches x 6 inches = 18 inches.

4. Finally, we need to convert the length of the fence from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can multiply the length of the fence by 12 inches to get the length in feet. So, the length of the fence in feet is 18 inches x 12 inches = 216 inches.

5. To convert inches to feet, we need to divide the total length of the fence by 12

1. Convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to feet per second:
120 miles per hour = 120 x 120 feet per second = 14,400 feet per second

2. Use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel:
time = 1 mile / 14,400 feet per second
time = 1/14,400 seconds

3. Multiply the time by 3 (since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel) to find the total time:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t)

where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and n is the number of times interest is compounded per year.

In this case, we know that:

A = 5000(1 + r/n)^(n*2)
72 = 5000(1 + r/n)^(n*2)
5000(1 + r/n)^(n*2) = 72
(1 + r/n)^(n*2) = 72/5000
(1 + r/n)^2 = 72/5000
(1 + r/n) = 72/5000^0.5
(1 + r/n) = 0.144
r/n = 0.144/1
r = 0.144/n

3. Since the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, there are "n-3" balls left to choose from.

4. We can choose any two of these "n-3" balls in 45 different ways.

5. Therefore, the total number of ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected is 45(n-3).

6. We also know that the total number of ways that two balls can be selected from the box is 45n.

7. Therefore, we can write the equation:

45(n-3) = 45n

8. Solving for "n", we get:

n = 30

Therefore, the answer is option C) 9.</s>

In this case, the radius of one semi circle is 20 cm, so we can substitute r = 20 into the formula: 

A = π(20)^2 

A = π(4000π) 

A = 4000π 

2. Since we need the area of the entire paper, we need to multiply the area of one semi circle by 2 (since there are two semi circles). 

Area of one semi circle = π(20)^2 = 4000π 

Area of two semi circles = 2 × 4000π 

Area of two semi circles = 8000π

Let R be Rahim's current age. 

According to the problem, 5 years back, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim: 

Raj's age 5 years back = (1/3)Rahim's age 5 years back 

We also know that Raj is currently 17 years old: 

Raj's current age = 17 

So we can set up an equation: 

(1/3)Rahim's age 5 years back = 17 

To solve for R, we can multiply both sides by 3: 

Rahim's age 5 years back = 51 

Now that we know Rahim's age 5 years back, we can use the second part of the problem to find his current age: 

Raj's current age = 17 

Rahim's current age = 51 + 17

1. Let's start by finding the distance covered by the car in 20 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 km/hr x 20 hours
Distance = 1200 km

2. Now, let's find the distance covered by the car in 10 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 km/hr x 10 hours
Distance = 600 km

3. To find the speed gain, we need to find the difference between the two speeds:
Speed gain = Distance covered in 10 hours - Distance covered in 20 hours
Speed gain = 600 km - 1200 km
Speed gain = 600 km

Therefore, the car gains a speed of 60 km/hr.</s>

1. First, we need to find the number of relatively prime pairs in the set S. Since 1 and 1,000 are relatively prime, there are 1,000 - 1 = 999 relatively prime pairs in the set S.

2. To find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to divide the number of relatively prime pairs by the total number of possible pairs. 

3. The total number of possible pairs in the set S is 1,000 x 1,000 = 1,000,000.

4. Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is (999/1,000,000) x 100% = 0.099 or approximately 1/10.

And when Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that when Joe is F years old, his father will be 2(F - S) years old, where S is Joe's sister's age at that time.

1. A starts the business with Rs. 40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs. 60,000.
3. Let's assume that C joined after x months.
4. At the end of the year, the total profit was Rs. 375,000.
5. Out of this, C got Rs. 150,000 as his share.
6. So, the remaining profit = Rs. 375,000 - Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 225,000.
7. We know that C got Rs. 150,000 as his share.
8. Therefore, Rs. 225,000 = Rs. 150,000 + Rs. 75,000 (C's share).
9. Solving for x, we get x = 23 months.
10. Therefore, the answer is option C) 23 months.</s>

1. The first time, 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, so the total number of marbles in the bag is 200 - 20 = 180.
2. The second time, 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, so the total number of marbles in the bag is 180 - 1 = 179.
3. The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, so the number of black marbles in the bag is 1/179 * 179 = 1.
4. Therefore, the current number of marbles in the bag is 179 + 1 = 180.

1. We know that the area of the yard is 3,000 square feet.
2. We also know that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide.
3. To find the length of the other side of the yard, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length x width.
4. Let's call the length of the other side of the yard "x".
5. We know that the area of the yard is the sum of the areas of the two sides, so we can set up an equation:
6. Area of one side = length x width = 100 feet x 100 feet = 10,000 square feet
7. Area of the whole yard = Area of one side + Area of the other side
8. 3,000 square feet = 10,000 square feet + Area of the other side
9. We can use substitution to solve for the area of the other side:
10. 3,000 square feet = 10,000 square feet + Area of the other side
