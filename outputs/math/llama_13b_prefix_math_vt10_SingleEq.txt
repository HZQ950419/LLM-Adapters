1. Let x be the number of hours Tom paid to rent the bike.
2. The cost of renting the bike for x hours is 17 + 7x dollars.
3. We know that Tom paid 80 dollars, so we can set up an equation:
17 + 7x = 80
4. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 7:
x = 10
5. Therefore, Tom paid 10 hours to rent the bike. 

Steps:

- 0.2 of a loaf of wheat bread = 0.2 x 16 = 3.2 loaves of wheat bread
- 0.4 of a loaf of white bread = 0.4 x 16 = 6.4 loaves of white bread

2. Add the fractions to find the total number of loaves served:
- 3.2 loaves of wheat bread + 6.4 loaves of white bread = 9.6 loaves in total

Therefore, the restaurant served a total of 9.6 loaves of bread. The answer in Arabic numerals is 9.6.</s>

1. Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of roses Mary cut from her flower garden. 

We know that there were 6 roses in the vase initially, so we can write: 

6 = x + 6 

We also know that there are now 16 roses in the vase, so we can write: 

16 = x + 6 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides: 

16 - 6 = x + 6 - 6 

Simplifying: 

10 = x 

Therefore, Mary cut 10 roses from her flower garden.

So, each student will get 4 dozen pencils, which is equal to 4 x 48 = 192 pencils.

To find out how many pencils the teacher will have to give out, we need to subtract the number of pencils each student will get from the total number of pencils available.

According to the problem: 

0.20x - 4 = 6 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

First, we'll add 4 to both sides of the equation: 

0.20x - 4 + 4 = 6 + 4 

0.20x = 10 

Finally, we'll isolate x by dividing both sides by 0.20:

1. Let's call the amount of money in the account before the transfer "x". 

2. We know that Christina transferred $69 out of the account, so we can set up an equation: 

x - 69 = 26,935 

3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 69 from both sides: 

x - 69 - 69 = 26,935 - 69 

4. Simplifying the equation: 

x - 138 = 26,935

We know that before the housing boom, there were 1,426 houses in Lawrence County. During the housing boom, developers built x houses. After the housing boom, there were 2,000 houses. 

So we can write an equation: 

1,426 + x = 2,000 

Subtracting 1,426 from both sides: 

x = 2,000 - 1,426

x - 9 = 4

1. Let's call the original amount of grain the ship contained "x".
2. After the crash, 49,952 tons of grain spilled into the water.
3. The total amount of grain onboard after the crash is x - 49,952.
4. We know that 918 tons of grain remain onboard, so we can set up the equation: x - 49,952 = 918.
5. Solving for x, we can subtract 49,952 from both sides: x - 49,952 = 918.
6. Simplifying, we get: x = 49,034.
7. Therefore, the ship originally contained 49,034 tons of grain.</s>

1. Let's represent the cost of one book with the variable "x".
2. We know that Sam had 79 dollars to spend on 9 books, so we can write an equation: 

79x = total cost of books 

3. We also know that Sam had 16 dollars left after buying the books, so we can write another equation: 

79x = 16 

4. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 79: 

x = 16/79 

5. Finally, we can convert x to dollars by multiplying it by the cost of one book: 

x = 16/79 * 1 = 2 

Therefore, each book cost 2 dollars.</s>

1) Let's use "M" to represent the number of stamps that Minerva has. 

2) We know that Lizette has 125 more stamps than Minerva, so we can set up an equation: 

813 = M + 125 

3) To solve for M, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 125 from both sides: 

813 - 125 = M 

4) Simplifying the equation, we get: 

688 = M 

Therefore, Minerva has 688 stamps. 

Steps:

To find the total distance hiked:
240 feet + 480 feet + 120 feet = 840 feet

To convert feet to miles:
840 feet x 1200 feet/mile = 1 mile

Therefore, Irwin's family hiked 1 mile in all.</s>

Spencer walked 0.4 of a mile from the post office back home, so he walked 0.4 x 5,280 = 2,112 feet.

To find the total distance Spencer walked, we add up the distances for each leg of his journey:

4. Total number of seashells Tom found = 5
5. Number of seashells Tom gave to Jessica = 2
6. Number of seashells Tom has now = Total number of seashells - Number of seashells he gave to Jessica
7. Number of seashells Tom has now = 5 - 2
8. Number of seashells Tom has now = 3

Therefore, Tom now has 3 seashells. The answer in Arabic numerals is 3.</s>
