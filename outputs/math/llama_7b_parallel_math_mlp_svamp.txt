1. Find the total number of items given to the 4 friends: 

32 crackers + 98 cakes = 130 items 

2. Divide the total number of items by the number of friends: 

130 items ÷ 4 friends = 32.5 items per friend 

3. Round to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a cracker or cake: 

33 crackers per friend 

Therefore, each person ate 33 crackers.</s>

- Number of pots = 141
- Number of flowers in each pot = 71
- Number of sticks in each pot = 91

2. Use the given information to find the total number of flowers:
To find the total number of flowers, we need to multiply the number of pots by the number of flowers in each pot and then multiply that by the number of sticks in each pot.

Total number of flowers = (Number of pots) x (Number of flowers in each pot) x (Number of sticks in each pot)

Total number of flowers = 141 x 71 x 91

Total number of flowers = 10,000

Therefore, there are 10,000 flowers in all.</s>

- Recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar
- Mary already put in some cups of flour
- Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar

2. Use the given information to set up an equation:
Let x be the number of cups of flour Mary still needs to add.
Then, the equation becomes:
6 cups + x cups = 13 cups + 8 cups
Simplifying the equation:
6 cups + x cups = 21 cups
Subtracting 6 cups from both sides:
x cups = 15 cups

1. Let x be the number of children who were riding on the bus before the bus stop.
2. At the bus stop, 2 more children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus became x + 2.
3. We know that the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop is 41, so we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 41.
4. Solving for x, we subtract 2 from both sides: x = 41 - 2.

3. The total number of students that suggested both mashed potatoes and bacon is x + (x + 166).
4. We know that the total number of students that suggested both mashed potatoes and bacon is 182. So, we can write an equation:
x + (x + 166) = 182
5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 166 = 182
6. Subtracting 166 from both sides, we get:

1. Let x be the number of cards Nell had initially.
2. According to the problem, Nell gave 301 cards to Jeff, so she now has 154 cards left. We can write this as an equation: x - 301 = 154.
3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 301 to both sides: (x - 301) + 301 = 154 + 301.
4. Simplifying the equation: x = 455.
