1. Let x be the number of apples that Jackie has.
2. According to the problem, Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has x + 4 apples.
3. Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 4) = 14.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 4 = 14.
5. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: 2x = 10.
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 5.
7. Therefore, Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.
8. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 9 + 6 = 15 apples.

Therefore, Bob has 15 apples.</s>

- Number of pots = 141
- Number of flowers in each pot = 71
- Number of sticks in each pot = 91

2. Use the given information to find the total number of flowers:
To find the total number of flowers, we need to multiply the number of pots by the number of flowers in each pot and then multiply that by the number of sticks in each pot.

Total number of flowers = (Number of pots) x (Number of flowers in each pot) x (Number of sticks in each pot)

Total number of flowers = 141 x 71 x 91

Total number of flowers = 10,000

Therefore, there are 10,000 flowers in all.</s>

- Mary already put in some cups of flour
- Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar

2. Use the given information to set up an equation:
Let x be the number of cups of flour Mary still needs to add.
Then, the equation becomes:
6 cups + x cups = 13 cups + 8 cups
Simplifying the equation:
6 cups + x cups = 21 cups
Subtracting 6 cups from both sides:

2. He found 22 bottle caps at the park, so he now has x + 22 bottle caps.
3. He also found 8 wrappers, so he now has x + 22 + 8 = x + 30 wrappers.
4. We are told that he now has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers, so we can set up an equation:
x + 30 = 28
5. Solving for x, we get:
x = 28 - 30
6. Simplifying, we get:
x = -2

Therefore, Danny had -2 bottle caps at first.</s>

1. Let x be the number of children who were riding on the bus before the bus stop.
2. At the bus stop, 2 more children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus became x + 2.
3. We know that the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop is 41, so we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 41.
4. Solving for x, we subtract 2 from both sides: x = 41 - 2.

3. The total number of students that suggested both mashed potatoes and bacon is x + (x + 166).
4. We know that the total number of students that suggested both mashed potatoes and bacon is 182. So, we can write an equation:
x + (x + 166) = 182
5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 166 = 182

1. Let x be the number of cards Nell had initially.
2. According to the problem, Nell gave 301 cards to Jeff, so she now has 154 cards left. We can write this as an equation: x - 301 = 154.
3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 301 to both sides: (x - 301) + 301 = 154 + 301.
4. Simplifying the equation: x = 455.
