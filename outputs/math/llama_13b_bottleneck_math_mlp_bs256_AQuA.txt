1. Let's assume that the breadth of the rectangular piece is "x" meters.
2. According to the problem, the length of the rectangular piece is "4x + 1" meters.
3. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(length + breadth).
4. Substituting the given values, we get: P = 2(4x + 1) = 2(4x + 1) = 8x + 2.
5. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 8x + 2 meters.
6. We are given that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m.
7. Using the formula: A = P x B, where A is the area and P is the perimeter, we get: 150 = 8x + 2 x B.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 150 = 8x + 2B.
9. Subtracting 2B from both sides, we get: 150 - 2B = 8x.

To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to find the total distance covered by the plane and divide it by the total time taken.

Let's assume that the side of the square is 'x' km.

So, the total distance covered by the plane is 4x km.

Let's assume that the time taken by the plane to cover each side is 't' hours.

So, the total time taken by the plane to cover the four sides of the square is 4t hours.

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 4x / 4t
Average speed = x / t

Now, we need to find the value of 't' from the given information.

Let's assume that the speed of the plane on the first side is 200 km/hr.

So, the time taken by the plane to cover the first side is:

Time taken = Distance / Speed
Time taken = 200 / 200

1. First, we need to find the probability that exactly 4 registered voters voted in the last election. We can do this by using the binomial distribution formula:

P(X=4) = (n choose 4) * p^4 * (1-p)^(n-4)

where n is the total number of registered voters and p is the probability that one registered voter voted in the last election.

2. In this case, n = 5 and p = 0.9 (90% or 0.90).

3. Plugging these values into the binomial distribution formula, we get:

P(X=4) = (5 choose 4) * 0.9^4 * (1-0.9)^(5-4)
P(X=4) = 5 * 0.125 * 0.8125
P(X=4) = 0.0625

4. Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly 4 registered voters voted in the last election is 0.0625 or 6.25%.

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is given by:

P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

where n is the total number of objects and r is the number of objects we are taking at a time.

In this case, n = 7 (the total number of letters in the word "PROBLEC") and r = 7 (since we are arranging all 7 letters).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(7,7) = 7! / (7-7)! = 7!

1. Let's start by finding the wholesale cost of the appliance. We know that the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, so we can set up the equation:

Original Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + 60% of Wholesale Cost

2. We also know that the appliance was actually sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so we can set up another equation:

Sale Price = 0.8 x Original Retail Price

3. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Sale Price = 0.8 x (Wholesale Cost + 60% of Wholesale Cost)

4. Simplifying this equation, we get:

Sale Price = 0.8 x Wholesale Cost + 0.8 x 60% of Wholesale Cost
Sale Price = 0.8 x Wholesale Cost + 0.48 x Wholesale Cost
Sale Price = 1.28 x Wholesale Cost

5. Since the lake is fully covered with water lilies after x days, the number of water lilies on the lake must be 2^x.
6. Therefore, 64 + 2^x - 1 = 2^x, which simplifies to 2^x - 64 = 1.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 60.

1. Let's assume R's age to be x.
2. According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, Q's age = x - 2y, where y is T's age.
3. We know that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, x + y = 50.
4. Solving for y, we get y = 50 - x.
5. Substituting this value of y in the equation x - 2y = Q's age, we get x - 2(50 - x) = Q's age.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get x - 100 = Q's age.
7. Adding 100 to both sides, we get Q's age = x + 100.
8. Therefore, Q's age = x + 100, where x is R's age.
9. Now, we need to find the difference between R's age and Q's age.

This can be done by using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is n! / (n-r)! 

So, the total number of ways to arrange 10 speakers is 10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5,040. 

Step 2: Find the number of arrangements where the PM speaks before the MP.

The formula for simple interest is:

Simple Interest = (P x R x T) / 100

Where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Given, P = Rs. 5000, R = 72, and T = 2 years.

Substituting these values in the formula, we get:

Simple Interest = (5000 x 72 x 2) / 100
Simple Interest = 36000

The formula for compound interest is:

Compound Interest = P x (1 + R/100)^T

Where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Given, P = Rs. 5000, R = 72, and T = 2 years.

Substituting these values in the formula, we get:

Compound Interest = 5000 x (1 + 72/100)^2
Compound Interest = 5000 x 1

1. We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51.
2. Let's assume that the least integer is -50. So, the first integer would be -50 and the last integer would be k.
3. Therefore, the sum of k consecutive integers would be:

-50 + (k-1) + k = 51

4. Simplifying the equation, we get:

k(k-1) + 50 = 51

5. Dividing both sides by 50, we get:

k(k-1) = 101

6. Solving for k, we get:

k = 101/((k-1)-1)

7. Substituting k-1 with 100, we get:

k = 101/((100-1)-1)

8. Simplifying the equation, we get x + shadow of tree = 24
9. Subtracting the shadow of the tree from both sides, we get x = 24 - shadow of tree
10. We know that the shadow of the tree is 15 metres.
11. So, x = 24 - 15 = 9
12. Therefore, the height of the tree is 9 metres.

Answer: The height of the tree is 9

1. First, we need to find the total cost of producing 420 units of the component per month: 

420 units x $110/unit = $47,200 

2. Next, we need to find the total revenue from selling 420 units of the component per month: 

420 units x $x/unit = $x 

3. To find the minimum selling price that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue: 

$x - $47,200 = $626,400 - $47,200 = $589,200 

4. Solving for x, we divide both sides by $589,200: 

x / $589,200 = $47,200 / $589,200 

x = $47,200

2. After the first 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, there were x - 20 marbles left in the bag.
3. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black. So, after the second 20 marbles were pulled out, there were (x - 20) + 20 - 1 = x - 19 marbles left in the bag.
4. We know that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. So, if there were x - 19 marbles left in the bag after the second 20 marbles were pulled out, then the percentage of black marbles in the bag is (x - 19)/(x - 20) = 0.95.
