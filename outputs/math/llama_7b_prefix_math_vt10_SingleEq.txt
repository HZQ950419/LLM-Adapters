We can start by using a proportion to solve the problem. 

Let x be the total number of loaves served. 

According to the problem, the restaurant served 0.2 of a loaf of wheat bread and 0.4 of a loaf of white bread. 

We can set up the proportion: 

0.2/x = 0.4/x 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

0.2x = 0.4x 

Dividing both sides by 0.4: 

0.2x ÷ 0.4 = 0.25x ÷ 0.4 

Multiplying both sides by 4: 

0.2x = 1 

Dividing both sides by 0.2: 

x = 5

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of puppies Alyssa had to start with. 

According to the problem, she gave 7 puppies to her friends, so she now has x - 7 puppies left. 

We also know that she has 5 puppies left, so we can set up the equation: 

x - 7 = 5 

To solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation: 

x - 7 + 7 = 5 + 7 

Simplifying: 

x = 12 

Therefore, Alyssa had 12 puppies to start with.

Let the three consecutive even numbers be x, x+2, and x+4. 

We know that the sum of three consecutive even numbers is 162. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

x + (x+2) + (x+4) = 162 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

3x + 6 = 162 

To find the smallest of the three numbers, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get: 

3x = 156

4. Total cost of the toys = $9.14 + $6.81 = $15.95
5. Amount paid with the $20 bill = $6.81
6. Change received = Total cost of the toys - Amount paid with the $20 bill
7. Change received = $15.95 - $6.81
8. Change received = $9.14

Therefore, Sandy received $9.14 in change.</s>

Let's use "x" to represent the amount of money that was in the account before the transfer.

According to the problem, the account now has $26,935 left in it. So we can set up an equation:

x - 69 = 26935

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 69 from both sides:

x - 69 - 69 = 26935 - 69

Simplifying the left side:

x - 64 = 26346

Subtracting 64 from both sides:

x = 25702

Therefore, the amount of money that was in the account before the transfer was $25,702.</s>

Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the amount of flour needed to make one loaf of bread. 

According to the problem, Mrs. Hilt needs 5 cups of flour to bake 2 loaves of bread. So we can set up the equation: 

5 cups = 2 loaves x amount of flour 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by the amount of flour per loaf: 

5 cups ÷ 2 loaves = x ÷ 1 loaf 

Simplifying: 

2.5 cups = x 

Therefore, Mrs. Hilt will need 2.5 cups of flour to make one loaf of bread.

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. Let x be the number of fish in each fishbowl. 

According to the problem, there are 261 fishbowls and each fishbowl has 23 fish. 

We can set up an equation to represent this information: 

261x = 23x + 23 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 23x from both sides: 

261x - 23x = 23 

Simplifying: 

236x = 23 

Dividing both sides by 23: 

x = 1 

Therefore, there are 1 fish in each fishbowl. 

Answer: 1 fish. (

Let's call the height of the shortest player "x". 

According to the problem, the tallest player is 77.75 inches tall, which is 9.5 inches taller than the shortest player. So we can write an equation:

77.75 = x + 9.5 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 9.5 from both sides:

77.75 - 9.5 = x 

Simplifying:

68.25 = x 

So the shortest player is 68.25 inches tall.

4. To find out what amount of money Tony had then, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and the hot dog from the initial amount of money.

Step 1: Subtract the cost of the ticket from $20.
$20 - $8 = $12

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the hot dog from $12.
$12 - $3 = $9

Therefore, Tony had $9 then. The answer in Arabic numerals is 9.</s>

Let the three consecutive odd numbers be x, x+1, and x+2. 

We know that x, x+1, and x+2 are all odd numbers. 

We also know that the sum of three consecutive odd numbers is always odd. 

Therefore, we can write: 

x + (x+1) + (x+2) = odd 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

3x + 3 + 2x = odd 

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 

6x + 6 = odd 

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get: 

6x = even 

Dividing both sides by 6, we get: 

x = evenly divisible by 6

To find out how many dozen quarters Sara has, we need to divide the total number of quarters she has by 12. 

Step 1: Determine the total number of quarters Sara has. 

Sara has 9 dollars, which is equal to 9 x 25 cents per dollar = 225 cents. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so Sara has 225/4 = 56 quarters. 

Step 2: Divide the total number of quarters by 12. 

56 quarters ÷ 12 = 4 

Therefore, Sara has 4 dozen quarters.

x + 489 = 2778
3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 489 from both sides:
x + 489 - 489 = 2778 - 489
x = 2291

1 pound is equal to 16 ounces.

Kelly bought 0.1 pounds of peanuts, which is equal to 0.1 x 16 ounces = 2.4 ounces of peanuts.

Kelly also bought 0.4 pounds of raisins, which is equal to 0.4 x 16 ounces = 6.4 ounces of raisins.

To find the total amount of snacks Kelly bought, we need to add the amount of peanuts and raisins she bought: 2.4 + 6.4 = 8.8 ounces.

Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, we can convert 8.8 ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 8.8 ÷ 16 = 0.53
