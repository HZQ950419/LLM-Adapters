1. Let's start by finding the breadth of the rectangular piece of land. We know that the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, so:

Length = 4 x Breadth + 1
Length = 4 x Breadth + 5

2. Now we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 x (Length + Breadth)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2 x (4 x Breadth + 5)
Perimeter = 2

1. Convert w/25 gallons per second to gallons per minute: 
w/25 = 1/25 gallons per minute 

2. Let x be the number of seconds it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain. 

3. Use the formula: time = distance / rate 

4. Distance = y gallons 
Rate = w/25 gallons per minute 

5. Solve for time: 
time = y / (w/25) 

6. Simplify: 
time = y / (1/25) 

7. Divide both sides by 1/25: 
time = y 

Therefore, it will take y gallons to pass through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons per minute. The answer is y.</s>

1. Let the weight of the new man be x kg.
2. The total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement was 10x kg.
3. After the replacement, the total weight of the 10 oarsmen became 10(x+1.8) kg.
4. We know that the total weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg, so we can set up the equation:
10(x+1.8) = 10x + 1.8
5. Solving for x, we get:
x + 1.8 = 10x/10 + 1.8
6. Simplifying, we get:
x + 1.8 = 11.8

1. Let x be the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought.
2. The coin-diver earns 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. Therefore, her total earnings from x copper coins and y brass coins are 20x + 25y.
3. We know that she earned $3.40 after one dive, so we can set up the equation:
20x + 25y = 3.40
4. Solving for y, we get:
y = 3.40 - 20x
5. Substituting x = 0, we get:
y = 3.40 - 20(0)
y = 3.40

3. If the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, then it was sold for 0.8(1.6x) = 1.2x.
4. To find the percent more than the wholesale cost, we need to subtract the wholesale cost from the selling price: 1.2x - x = 0.2x.

2. We know that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can write an equation: 

x + y = 10 + 18 

3. We also know that the digit in the ten's place is double the digit in the unit's place, so we can write another equation: 

x = 2y 

4. Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: 

2y + y = 10 + 18 

5. Simplifying the equation: 

3y + y = 28 

6. Subtracting y from both sides:

3. When folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 2(x + y).
4. We know that 2x + 2y = 48 when folded along one set of sides and 2(x + y) = 66 when folded along the other set of sides.
5. We can set up an equation to solve for x and y:
2x + 2y = 48

3. Now we can solve for Rahim's age 5 years back:
Rahim's age 5 years back = (1/3) x 17
Rahim's age 5 years back = 59

4. To find out Rahim's current age, we need to add 5 years to his age 5 years back:

V = π(2^2 + 15^2) = π(4 + 60) = π(64) = π(25) = 6.25 cubic mm

Since the weight of the coin is 30 grams, we can find the mass of the aluminum and silver in the alloy by dividing the weight of the coin by its volume:

Mass of aluminum = 30 / 6.25 = 4.8 grams
Mass of silver = 30 / 6.25 = 4.8 grams

Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we can find the mass of aluminum in the pure aluminum coin by dividing the mass of silver by 2:

Mass of aluminum in pure aluminum coin = 4.8 / 2

30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. Let's call the original number "x". 

After subtracting 30 from x, we have x - 30. 

We know that (x - 30) / 3 is equal to x / 3. 

So we can set up the equation: 

x - 30 / 3 = x / 3 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x - 10 = x / 3 

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 

x = 30 

So the original number was 30. 

To find 50% of 30, we can multiply 30 by 0.5: 

50% of 30 = 0.5 x 30 = 15 

Therefore, the answer is E) 25.</s>

1. Let x be the number of times the coin landed on heads.
2. For each time the coin landed on heads, Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan, so Jonathan received 2x dollars.
3. For each time the coin landed on tails, Jonathan gave 3 dollars to Christopher, so Christopher received 3(2x) = 6x dollars.
4. After flipping the coin 20 times, the total amount received by Christopher is 6x * 20 = 120x dollars.
5. The total amount received by Jonathan is 2x * 20 = 40x dollars.
6. The total amount received by both of them is 120x + 40x = 160x dollars.
7. We know that none of them won or lost any amount, so 160x = 0.
8. Solving for x, we get x = 12.
Therefore, the answer is E) 12.</s>

1. Alan's probability of guessing correctly = 1/5
2. Roger's probability of guessing correctly = 2/3
3. Peter's probability of guessing correctly = 5/6
4. Total probability of guessing correctly = 1/5 + 2/3 + 5/6 = 11/18
5. Total probability of guessing correctly but not via cheating = 11/18 - (1/5 + 2/3 + 5/6) = 13/45

Therefore, the answer is E) 13/45.</s>

1. Cross-multiply 5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 with 13 × 13 - 156: 

5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 × 13 - 156 = 13 × 13 - 156 

2. Solve for ?: 

5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 13 - 156 

5 + ? × 19 - 15 = 13 × 13 - 156 - 7 

5 + ? × 19 - 15 = 13 × 13 - 156 + 7 

5 + ? × 19 - 15 = 13 × 13 - 156 - 7 + 7 

5 + ? × 19 - 15 = 13 × 13 - 156 - 7 + 7 

5 + ? × 19 - 15 =

1. We can use the formula: 

work = rate x time 

where rate is the amount of work done per unit of time, and time is the amount of time taken to complete the work. 

2. Let's assume that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. This means that the rate of work done by each man is x/x = 1 unit per day. 

3. Let's assume that y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days. This means that the rate of work done by each man is y/y = 1 unit per day. 

4. We can set up a proportion: 

x/x = y/y 

5. Cross-multiplying, we get: 

xy = xy 

6. Solving for xy, we get: 

xy = 1 

7. Therefore, the rate of work done by each man is 1 unit per day. 

8. To find the total amount of work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days,
