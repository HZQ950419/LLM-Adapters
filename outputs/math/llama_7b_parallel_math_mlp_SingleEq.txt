1. Let x be the number of hours Tom paid to have the bike checked out.
2. The total cost of renting the bike is 17 + 7x.
3. We know that Tom paid 80 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
17 + 7x = 80
4. Solving for x, we get:
x = 80/17 = 5
Therefore, Tom paid to have the bike checked out for 5 hours.</s>

1. Let x be the height of the shortest player in inches.
2. According to the problem, the tallest player is 9.5 inches taller than the shortest player, so the height of the tallest player is x + 9.5 inches.
3. We also know that the height of the tallest player is 77.75 inches. So we can set up the equation:
x + 9.5 = 77.75
4. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 9.5 from both sides:
x + 9.5 - 9.5 = 77.75 - 9.5
x = 68.25
5. Therefore, the shortest player is 68.25 inches tall.</s>
