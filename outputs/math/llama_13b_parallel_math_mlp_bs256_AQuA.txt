1. Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be x meters.
2. According to the problem, the length of the rectangular piece is 4x + 1 meters.
3. The perimeter of the rectangular piece is given by the formula: P = 2(length + breadth).
4. Substituting the values of length and breadth in the formula, we get: P = 2(4x + 1 + x) = 2(5x + 1).
5. Simplifying the expression for P, we get: P = 2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2.
6. Substituting the value of x = 1 in the expression for P, we get: P = 10(1) + 2 = 12.
7. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 12 meters.

Hence, the answer is option D) 63 m.</s>

1. Let's assume that the original price of each item is $100.
2. After the discount, the new price of each item is $80.
3. To get back to the original price, the shopkeeper needs to add 20% to the new price.
4. 20% of $80 is (20/100) x $80 = $16.
5. Therefore, the new price after adding 20% is $80 + $16 = $96.
6. To get the original price of $100, the shopkeeper needs to add 33.33% to the new price.
7. 33.33% of $96 is (33.33/100) x $96 = $31.
8. Therefore, the original price is $96 + $31 = $127.
9. To get the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25%.

Volume = length x width x height = 3 x 4 x 15 = 135

2. Next, we need to find the radius of the sphere, which is the distance from any point on the surface of the sphere to the center of the sphere. We know that all eight vertices of the rectangular solid are on the surface of the sphere, so we can use the distance formula to find the radius:
Radius = distance from any point on the surface of the sphere to the center of the sphere
Radius = sqrt((distance from any point on the surface of the sphere to the center of the sphere)^2 + (distance from any point on the surface of the sphere to the center of the sphere)^2)
Radius = sqrt((distance from any point on the surface of the sphere to the center of the sphere)^2 + (distance from any point on the surface of the sphere to the center of the sphere)^2)
Radius = sqrt(2(distance from any point on the surface of the sphere to the center of the sphere)^2)
Radius = sqrt(2(135)^2)

The total number of books to be arranged on the shelf is 5 (English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science).

To find the number of ways to arrange these books on the shelf, we can use the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is given by:

P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

where n is the total number of objects, and r is the number of objects to be arranged at a time.

In this case, n = 5 (the total number of books), and r = 5 (since we want to arrange all 5 books on the shelf).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(5,5) = 5! / (5-5)!
P(5,5) = 5! / (5-5)!
P(5,5) = 5! / (5-5)!
P(5,5) = 5! / (5-5)!
P(5,5) = 5! / (5-5)!

The total value of 50 paise coins = 50 paise x 700 = Rs. 35,000
The total value of one rupee coins = 100 paise x 700 = Rs. 70,000

Therefore, the total value of all the coins is Rs. 17,500 + Rs. 35,000 + Rs. 70,000 = Rs. 112,500

Let the number of 25 paise coins be x, the number of 50 paise coins be y and the number of one rupee coins be z.

To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to find the total distance covered by the plane and then divide it by the time taken.

Let's assume that the side of the square is 'a' km.

So, the total distance covered by the plane in one round will be 4a.

Let's assume that the time taken by the plane to complete one round is 't' seconds.

Therefore, the total distance covered by the plane in 't' seconds will be 4a * t.

To find the average speed of the plane, we need to divide this total distance by the time taken.

So, average speed = total distance / time

= 4a * t / t

= 4a

Since the plane flies along all four sides of the square, the total distance covered by the plane in one round will be 4a * 4 = 16a.

Therefore, the total distance covered by the plane in 't' seconds will be 16a * t.

Hence, the average speed of the plane around the field will be 16a / t.

1. Let's assume that the cost price of the appliance is $x.
2. According to the problem, the retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, which means the selling price is $1.40 for every $1 of cost price.
3. Therefore, the selling price of the appliance is $x + $1.40x = $1.40x + $x = $2.40x.
4. The gross profit of $20.00 is equal to the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is $20.00 = $2.40x - $x.
5. Solving for $x, we get $x = $20.00 - $2.40x.
6. Substituting $x = $20.00 - $2.40x into the expression for the selling price, we get $20.00 - $2.40x + $x = $2.40x + $x, which simplifies to $3.40x = $20.00

To find the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted, we need to subtract the number of faces that are painted from the total number of faces.

The number of faces that are painted is given by the thickness of the cube, which is 1 cm. Therefore, the number of faces that are painted is 6 x 1 = 6.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

We know that the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, so the selling price is 120% of the cost price. We can express this as:

Selling Price = 1.2 * Cost Price

We also know that the trader sold the article for Rs. 360, so we can set up the equation:

1.2 * Cost Price = 360

Solving for Cost Price, we get:

Cost Price = 360 / 1.2

Cost Price = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300. The answer is option B) 300.</s>

1. First, we need to convert the speed of the space shuttle from meters per second (m/s) to meters per second per second (m/s/s). 

700 m / 40 s = 17.5 m/s/s 

2. Next, we can use the formula: 

distance = speed x time 

We know the distance (700 m) and the speed (17.5 m/s/s), so we can solve for time: 

time = distance / speed 

time = 700 m / 17.5 m/s/s 

time = 40 s 

3. Finally, we can use the formula: 

distance = speed x time 

We know the distance (700 m) and the time (40 s), so we can solve for speed: 

speed = distance / time 

speed = 700 m / 40 s 

speed = 17.5 m/s

At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 for 4 years.

The simple interest formula is:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Where,
Principal = Rs. 500
Rate = 6% per annum
Time = 4 years

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:

Simple Interest = (500 × 6 × 4) / 100
Simple Interest = 2400 / 100
Simple Interest ≈ 24

Therefore, the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years is:

Let's assume that John had x amount of money.

According to Mark, if John gives him half of his money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, Mark's amount of money will be (x/2) - 75.

According to John, if he gives Mark one-third of his money, John will have Rs. 75. So, John's amount of money will be (x/3) + 75.

Equating both the equations, we get:

(x/2) - 75 = (x/3) + 75

Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get:

x - 75 = x + 75

Adding both sides, we get:

2x = 150

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 75

Therefore, John had Rs. 75.

Hence, the answer is option C) 28.</s>

The cost price of the book can be calculated as follows:

Profit = 10%
Selling Price = Rs. 27.50
Let the cost price be x
Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
27.50 = x + 0.10x
27.50 = 1.10x
x = 25

Therefore, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.

Now, let's calculate the profit/loss percentage when the book is sold for Rs. 25.75:

Profit/Loss = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100
Profit/Loss = (10/25) x 100
Profit/Loss = 40%

Therefore, the profit/loss percentage when the book is sold for Rs. 25.75 is 40%.

20% of $1.25 = $0.25

So the grocery makes $0.25 profit per bag of ice.

2. Next, we need to find out how much total profit the grocery makes if it sells 500 bags of ice. To do this, we multiply the profit per bag by the number of bags sold:

$0.25 x 500 = $125

Therefore, the grocery makes a total profit of $125 if it sells 500 bags of ice.

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube can be found by dividing the volume of the cube by the volume of the sphere. 

The volume of the cube is given by V = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube. 

The volume of the sphere is given by V_sphere = 4πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. 

Dividing the volume of the cube by the volume of the sphere, we get: 

V/V_sphere = s^3/4πr^3 

We want to find the ratio of the volumes of the cube and the sphere, which is V/V_sphere. 

Substituting the values of s and r, we get: 

V/V_sphere = (s^3/4π) / (4πr^3)

Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, we can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

Let's first calculate the distance Winson runs:

distance = speed x time
distance = 10 miles/hr x 1 hour
distance = 10 miles

Now let's calculate the distance Winson walks:

distance = speed x time
distance = 5 miles/hr x 1 hour
distance = 5 miles

Since the whole journey takes one hour, the total distance Winson covers is the sum of the distances he runs and walks:

10 speakers are to address the meeting, and the only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak, the PM should speak before the MP, and the MP should speak before the MLA.

Let's assume that the speakers are arranged in a line, with the PM at the front of the line, the MP next to the PM, and the MLA at the end of the line.

To determine the number of ways the meeting can be held, we need to count the number of ways the speakers can be arranged in the line. This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is:

P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

where n is the total number of objects, and r is the number of objects being taken at a time.

In this case, n = 10 (the total number of speakers), and r = 3 (since there are 3 speakers at a time).

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(10,3) = 10! / (10-3)! = 10!

1. Calculate the minimum daily requirement (MDR) of vitamin E:
- 9% of MDR = 0.09 x 200 = 18 grams

2. Calculate the minimum daily requirement (MDR) of vitamin A:
- 8% of MDR = 0.08 x 200 = 16 grams

3. Add the minimum daily requirements of vitamin E and vitamin A:
- 18 grams + 16 grams = 34 grams

4. Divide the total minimum daily requirement by the percentage of vitamins in the health food:
- 34 grams ÷ 9% + 8% = 34 grams ÷ 17%
- 34 grams ÷ 0.17 = 200 grams

Therefore, 200 grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. The answer is A) 8.5.</s>

The quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 can be factored as (x - r)(x - s) = 0, where r and s are the roots of the quadratic equation.

Since the quadratic equation has two real and distinct roots, the factors (x - r) and (x - s) are also real and distinct.

Therefore, the possible values of k that satisfy this condition are:

(x - r)(x - s) = 0

(x - r)(x - s) = x^2 - 5x + k

(x - r)(x - s) = x^2 - 5x

(x - r)(x - s) = x^2 - 5x

(x - r)(x - s) = x^2 - 5x

(x - r)(x - s) = x^2 - 5x

According to the problem, each employee contributes Rs. 60.

So, the total amount collected from all the employees = Rs. 6 lakh

If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total amount collected from all the employees would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh.

Therefore, the new total amount collected from all the employees = Rs. 6.24 lakh

So, the new total amount collected from all the employees = Rs. 60x + 60

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1. Let's assume that the maximum mark M is x.
2. According to the problem, the candidate secured 504 marks out of the maximum mark of M.
3. We can write this as: 504 = x/800
4. To find the value of M, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 800: 504 * 800 = x
5. Simplifying this equation, we get: 409600 = x
6. We also know that if the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks.
7. We can write this as: 420 = (x/800) * 800
8. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 800, we get: 336000 = x

1. The midpoint of line segment ST is halfway between points S and T, so U = (S + T) / 2.
2. We know that the length of line segment ST is 22, so U = (S + T) / 2 = (S + T) * 22 / 2 = S + T.
3. We also know that the length of line segment RS is 5, so R = S + 5.
4. Similarly, the length of line segment RT is 17, so T = R + 17.
5. Substituting R = S + 5 and T = R + 17 into the equation U = S + T, we get U = (S + 5) + (S + 17) = 2S + 22.
6. Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, we know that U = (S + T) / 2, so 2S + 22 = (S + T) / 2.

The formula for the area of a trapezium is:
Area = (a + b)h/2, where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides and h is the distance between them.

In this case, we know that the area is 640 square meters, the width at the top (a) is 10 meters, and the width at the bottom (b) is 6 meters. Let's use the letter d to represent the depth of the canal.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:
640 = (a + b)h/2
640 = (10 + 6)h/2
640 = 16h/2
h = 640/16
h = 40

3x - 90 = x

Adding 90 to both sides, we get:

4x = 100

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 25

Therefore, the original number is 25.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.

In this case, we know that:

A = $54,080
r = 8% = 0.08
n = 2 (since the interest is compounded semi-annually)
t = 1

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)
$54,080 = P(1 + 0.04)^2
$54,080 = P(1 + 0.04)^2
$54,080 = P(1.04)^2
$54,080 = P(1.08)

5 horses are in a race. Mr.Jain selects two of horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse can be calculated as follows:

Number of ways to select 2 horses out of 5 = 5C2 = 5 x 4/2 = 10

Number of ways to select 2 winning horses out of 5 = Number of ways to select 2 horses x Probability of selecting a winning horse
= 10 x 1/5
= 2

Therefore, the probability that Mr.Jain selected the winning horse is 2/5.

Hence, the answer is option B) 2/5.</s>

1. We know that the width of one side of the yard is 100 feet.
2. We also know that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet.
3. To find the length of the other side of the yard, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:
Area = length x width
4. Substituting the given values, we get:
3000 = length x 100
5. Solving for length, we get:
length = 3000 / 100
length = 30 feet

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet. The answer is A) 30.</s>

1. First, we need to find the total number of trains that run in a day. Since each train has a frequency of 10 minutes and there are two trains, the total number of trains in a day is 2 x 10 = 20.

2. Next, we need to find the total number of times the man can catch the first train in a day. Since there are 20 trains in a day and each train has a frequency of 10 minutes, the total number of times the man can catch the first train in a day is 20 x 10 = 200.

3. Finally, we can calculate the probability of the man catching the first train by dividing the total number of times the man can catch the first train by the total number of trains in a day and multiplying by 100.

Probability = (200/20) x 100 = 10

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 10%. The answer is option A) 0.9.</s>

1. Start at M and travel to N by 3 buses.
2. Start at N and travel to O by 4 buses.
3. Start at O and travel to P by 1 bus.
4. Start at P and travel to Q by 3 buses.

To find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to multiply the number of ways to travel from M to N, from N to O, from O to P, and from P to Q, and then add them together.

Number of ways to travel from M to N = 3
Number of ways to travel from N to O = 4
Number of ways to travel from O to P = 1
Number of ways to travel from P to Q = 3

Total number of ways to travel from M to Q = 3 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 11

Therefore, the answer is (D) 36.</s>

1. Let the monthly sales be x.
2. The shop assistant's monthly salary is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 and 5% of all monthly sales: S = $500 + 0.05x.
3. We want to find the monthly sales that will result in a monthly salary of $1500: S = $1500.
4. Substituting S = $1500 into the expression for the monthly salary, we get: $500 + 0.05x = $1500.
5. Solving for x, we get: 0.05x = $1000.
6. Dividing both sides by 0.05, we get: x = $20000.

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000. The answer is option C) $30000.</s>

There are 2 possible outcomes for each flip of the coin (heads or tails). Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for 20 flips is 2^20 = 4096.

Let's assume that the coin landed on heads x times. Then, the number of times it landed on tails would be 20-x.

Since each time the coin lands on heads, Christopher has to give $2 to Jonathan, and each time it lands on tails, Jonathan has to give $3 to Christopher, the total amount of money exchanged between them would be:

2(x) + 3(20-x) = 4x + 60

Since the total amount of money exchanged between them is $0, we can set up the equation:

4x + 60 = 0

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

4x = -60

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = -15

Therefore, the coin landed on heads 15 times.

1. Let's assume that x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days.
2. Therefore, the work efficiency of x men working x hours per day is 1/x units per day.
3. Now, let's assume that y men working y hours per day can do y units of a work in y days.
4. Therefore, the work efficiency of y men working y hours per day is 1/y units per day.
5. To find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days, we need to multiply the work efficiency of y men by y units of work and y days.
6. So, the amount of work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days is 1/y units per day * y units of work * y days = 1/y units.
7. Now, we need to find out how much work can be completed by x men working x hours per day in x days.
