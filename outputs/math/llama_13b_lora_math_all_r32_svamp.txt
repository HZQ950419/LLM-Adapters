1. Let's call the distance the frog jumped "x".
2. According to the problem, the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper jumped x + 25 inches.
3. The problem also tells us that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped x - 16 inches.
4. We know that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, so we can set up an equation:
x + 25 = 21
5. Solving for x, we get:
x = 21 - 25
x = -4
6. So the frog jumped 4 inches.
7. To find how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we subtract the distance the mouse jumped from the distance the grasshopper jumped:
x + 25 - (x - 16)
x + 25 - x + 16
29

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 29 inches farther than the mouse.</s>

2. According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework, so the number of pages she had to complete for math homework is x + 3.
3. We know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, so we can set up an equation: x + 3 = 8
4. Solving for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides: x = 5
5. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 5 pages of reading homework.
6. To find the total number of pages she had to complete, we can add the number of pages for reading and math homework: 5 + (x + 3) = 5 + 8
