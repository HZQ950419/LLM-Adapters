0.20 of a number decreased by 4 can be written as:

0.20x - 4

We are given that this expression is equal to 6:

0.20x - 4 = 6

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 4 to both sides:

0.20x - 4 + 4 = 6 + 4

Simplifying:

0.20x = 10

Dividing both sides by 0.20:

x = 50

3. We also know that the height of the tallest player is 77.75 inches. So we can set up an equation:
x + 9.5 = 77.75
4. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 9.5 from both sides:
x + 9.5 - 9.5 = 77.75 - 9.5
x = 68.25
