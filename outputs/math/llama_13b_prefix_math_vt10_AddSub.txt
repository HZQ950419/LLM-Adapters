2. We know that Christina transferred $69 out of the account, so we can set up an equation: 

x - 69 = 26935 

3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 69 from both sides: 

x - 69 - 69 = 26935 - 69 

4. Simplifying: 

x - 138 = 26246

x = 26246

To find the total weight of peppers bought by Hannah's Vegetarian Restaurant, we need to add the weight of green peppers and red peppers.

Weight of green peppers = 0.3333333333333333 pound
Weight of red peppers = 0.3333333333333333 pound

Total weight of peppers = Weight of green peppers + Weight of red peppers
Total weight of peppers = 0.3333333333333333 + 0.3333333333333333
Total weight of peppers = 0.6666666666666666

2. We know that the total number of inches repaved so far is 4938.
3. We also know that the number of inches repaved today is 805.
4. So we can set up an equation: 

x + 805 = 4938 

5. To solve for x, we can subtract 805 from both sides: 

x + 805 - 805 = 4938 - 805

Let x be the number of roses Mary cut from her flower garden. 

According to the problem, there were 6 roses in the vase initially, and Mary added x roses to the vase. So the total number of roses in the vase after Mary added her roses is 6 + x. 

Then the problem states that there are now 16 roses in the vase. So we can set up an equation: 

6 + x = 16 

To solve for x, we can isolate it by subtracting 6 from both sides: 

x = 16 - 6 

x = 10 

Therefore, Mary cut 10 roses from her flower garden.</s>

To find the total distance Craig walked, we need to add the distance he walked from school to David's house and the distance he walked from David's house to his own house.

Distance from school to David's house = 0.2 mile
Distance from David's house to Craig's house = 0.7 mile

Total distance = Distance from school to David's house + Distance from David's house to Craig's house
Total distance = 0.2 + 0.7

1. Let x be the number of puppies Alyssa had to start with.
2. Alyssa gave 7 puppies to her friends, so she had x - 7 puppies left.
3. Alyssa now has 5 puppies, so she has a total of x - 7 + 5 puppies.
4. We can set up an equation: x - 7 + 5 = the total number of puppies Alyssa had to start with.
5. Solving for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides: x - 7 = the total number of puppies Alyssa had to start with.
6. Dividing both sides by -7, we get: x = the total number of puppies Alyssa had to start with.

1. Let's start by setting up an equation to represent the problem: 

Fred's money = Jason's money 

Fred's money = 23 dollars 

Jason's money = 46 dollars 

2. We know that Fred washed cars over the weekend and now has 86 dollars, so we can set up another equation: 

Fred's money after washing cars = 86 dollars 

3. To find out how much money Fred made washing cars, we need to subtract his original amount of money from his current amount of money: 

86 dollars - 23 dollars = 63 dollars 

Therefore, Fred made 63 dollars washing cars. 

Answer: Fred made 63 dollars washing cars.</s>

1) Let's call the total number of acres on the prairie "x". 

2) We know that 64535 acres were covered in dust, so we can set up the equation: 

x - 522 = 64535 

3) To solve for x, we can subtract 522 from both sides: 

x - 522 = 64535 - 522 

4) Simplifying: 

x = 64013 

Therefore, the prairie covers 64013 acres. 

Steps:

1) Let's call the number of gallons of blue paint "x". 

2) We know that the company used a total of 6689 gallons of paint. 

3) We also know that they used 660 gallons of white paint. 

4) To find out how many gallons of blue paint they used, we can set up an equation: 

x + 660 = 6689 

5) Solving for x, we can subtract 660 from both sides: 

x = 6689 - 660 

6) Simplifying, we get: 

x = 6029 

7) Therefore, the company used 6029 gallons of blue paint. 

8) The answer in Arabic numerals is: 6029
