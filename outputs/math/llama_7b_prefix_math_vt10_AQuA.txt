1. Let the breadth of the piece be x sq m.
2. According to the problem, the length is 1m more than 4x sq m. Therefore, the length is 4x + 1 sq m.
3. The perimeter of the piece is the sum of all its sides. Therefore, the perimeter is 2(length + breadth) sq m.
4. Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get:
Perimeter = 2(4x + 1 + x) sq m
Perimeter = 2(5x + 1) sq m
Perimeter = 2(5x + 1) sq m
Perimeter = 2(5x + 1) sq m
Perimeter = 2(5x + 1) sq m
Perimeter = 2(5x + 1) sq m
Perimeter = 2

1. M = abc is a three digit number.
2. N = cba is a three digit number.
3. M - N + 396c = 990.
4. We need to find the number of values of M that are more than 300.
5. We can simplify the equation as follows:
M - N + 396c = 990
396c = 990 - M + N
396c = 990 - 1000 + N
396c = -1000
396 = -1000/c

2. We also know that the total amount in the money pouch is Rs 700. So we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 700

3. Now we need to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for "x".

4. Subtract "y" from both sides of the equation:
x + y = 700 - y

5. Divide both sides by "x":

1. Let's call the number we're trying to find "x".
2. According to the problem, we know that:
- x is greater than 36
- x is less than 86
3. We can use these two statements to create an equation:
- x = 36 + y (x is greater than 36)
- x = 86 - z (x is less than 86)
4. We can solve for y or z by subtracting 36 from one side and adding 86 to the other side:
- y = 36 - x (y is the amount x is less than 36)
- z = x - 86 (z is the amount x is greater than 86)
5. Now we can substitute one of these expressions into the other equation to solve for x:
- y = 36 - x

We can start by simplifying the numerator and denominator of the fraction:

[(272 - 32) (124 + 176)] / (17 x 15 - 15) = [(272 - 32) x 124 + (272 - 32) x 176 + (124 + 176) x (17 x 15 - 15)] / (17 x 15 - 15)

Simplifying the first term:

[(272 - 32) x 124 + (272 - 32) x 176] = [(272 - 32) x 290]

Simplifying the second term:

[(272 - 32) x 176]

1. Given that the liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds.
2. We are given that y gallons will pass through the drain.
3. We need to find how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain.
4. We can set up the equation:
w/25 = y/x
5. Solving for x, we get:
x = y/w
6. Substituting this value of x into the equation we get:
w/25 = y/y/w
7. Multiplying both sides by y/w, we get:
w = 25y
8. Substituting this value of w into the original equation, we get:
y/x = 25y/x
9. Solving for x, we get:
x = y/2

3. The amount of money she earned from bringing y brass coins is 25y cents.
4. The total amount of money she earned from bringing all the coins is 20x + 25y cents.
5. We know that the total amount of money she earned is $3.40, so we can set up an equation:
20x + 25y = 3.40
6. We can solve for y by dividing both sides by 25:
y = 1.60

1 gram of a certain health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to eat at least 100% of both vitamins.

Therefore, the minimum daily requirement of vitamins E and A is:

Vitamin E: 100% * 0.09 = 9.0%
Vitamin A: 100% * 0.08 = 8.0%

The minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is:

12 miles per hour is equivalent to 12 miles per 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

To find the number of minutes it will take to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour, we can use the formula: 

Time = Distance / Speed 

Time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour 

Time = 4 hours 

Therefore, it will take 4 hours to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour. 

Steps: 
1. Convert miles per hour to minutes per hour: 12 miles per hour = 12 miles per 60 minutes = 2 minutes per mile

30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. Let's call that number "x". 

According to the problem, we know that:

x - 30 = (1/3)x 

To find 50% of x, we can use the formula:

(x/100) * 100 = 50 

Plugging in the values we get:

(x/100) * 100 = (1/3)x * 100 

Simplifying:

(x/100) * 100 = x 

Multiplying both sides by 100:

1. First, we need to find the total number of lime soda bottles: 
10 bottles 

2. Next, we need to find the total number of customers: 
5 members in each group x 2 groups = 10 customers 

3. To find the number of ways to create these 2 groups, we need to divide the total number of customers by the number of groups: 
10 customers ÷ 2 groups = 5 ways 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 252. 

Steps: 
1. Total number of lime soda bottles = 10 
2. Total number of customers = 5 members in each group x 2 groups = 10 customers 
3. To find the number of ways to create these 2 groups, we need to divide the total number of customers by the number of groups

1. Let the monthly sales be x.
2. The fixed salary is $500.
3. Therefore, the total monthly salary is $500 + 5% of x.
4. We can write this as 0.05x + $500.
5. We want the total monthly salary to be $1500, so we can set up the equation:
0.05x + $500 = $1500
6. Solving for x, we get:
x = $1500/0.05 - $500
x = $3000 - $500
x = $2500
7. Therefore, the monthly sales should be $2500.
Answer: C. The monthly sales should be $2500.</s>

1. Let's assume that the coin landed on heads 20 times.
2. Each time the coin landed on heads, Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan.
3. Therefore, the total amount Christopher gave to Jonathan is 20 x $2 = $40.
4. Similarly, each time the coin landed on tails, Jonathan gave 3 x $2 = $6 to Christopher.
5. Therefore, the total amount Jonathan gave to Christopher is 20 x $6 = $120.
6. Therefore, the total amount they gave to each other is $40 + $120 = $160.
7. Since neither of them won or lost any amount, the answer is E.</s>

1. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly.
2. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly.
3. Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer.
4. To find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to subtract the probability of cheating (2/3) from the probability of answering correctly (5/6).
5. Therefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating is:
(5/6) - (2/3) = (5/6) - (1/3) = (4/6) = 8/6 = 1.33333333333333

We can start by simplifying the numerator of the fraction:

[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156]

= [5 + ? × 19 - 15 + 7]/[13 × 13 - 156]

= [5 + 19 - 15 + 7]/[13 × 13 - 156]

= [5 + 19 - 15 + 7]/[13 × 13]

= [5 + 19 - 15 + 7]/[13 × 13]

= [5 + 19 - 15]/[13 × 13]

= [5 × 13 - 15]/[13 × 13]

1. A starts travel towards south 3km.
2. A travels 5 km towards east.
3. A travels 3 km to north.
4. A travels 2km towards west.

To find the total distance traveled by A, we need to add up all the distances:

3 km (south) + 5 km (east) + 3 km (north) + 2 km (west) = 15 km

Therefore, A has traveled a total distance of 15 km and is 15 km away from home. The answer is option (C) 4km.</s>

1. Given:
x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days

2. Let's assume that y men are working for y hours per day in y days.

3. Therefore, the work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days can be expressed as:
y men working y hours per day in y days = x men working x hours per day in x days

4. Substituting the given values, we get:
y men working y hours per day in y days = x men working x hours per day in x days

5. Multiplying both sides by y/x, we get:
y/x = x/y

6. Solving for y/x, we get:
y/x = x/y

7. Substituting x/y for y/x, we get:
