1. Let x be the age of one triplet.
2. According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so the age of one twin is x + 7.
3. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplets is 44, so (x + 7) + x = 44.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 7 = 44.
5. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 2x = 37.
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 18.5.
7. Since the problem asks for the age of one triplet, we take x to be 18.5.

1. Let x be the time it took for Donovan's part of the meal.
2. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.
3. The total time it took to make the meal was 98 minutes, so we can set up an equation:
x + (x + 18) = 98
4. Simplifying the equation:
2x + 18 = 98
2x = 70
x = 35
5. Now that we know Donovan's part took 35 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to Donovan's part:
Betsy's part = 35 + 18 = 53

2. According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. So, Emil's age at that time will be (1/2)x.

3. Also, when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, Emil's age at that time will be 2y.

4. We know that Emil is currently 19 years old. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x and y:

x + y = 19

5. Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 19 - y
y = 19 - x

6. Substituting x = 19 - y and y = 19 - x in the equation x + y = 19, we get:

1. Let x be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set.
2. In the second set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the first, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so he retrieved (x + 4) / 2 balls.
4. In all, he retrieved 19 balls, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 4) + [(x + 4) / 2] = 19
5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 4 = 19
6. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
2x = 15
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 7.5
8. Therefore, Rory retrieved 7.5 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

1. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.
2. His dad tells him he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which means he can have 5/2 = 2.5 carrot sticks.
3. He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room, so he can have a total of 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 carrot sticks.
4. Since he wants to eat 5 cookies in total, he needs to eat 5 - 4.5 = 0.5 more carrot sticks.
5. Therefore, he needs to eat 4.5 + 0.5 = 5 carrot sticks.

1. Calculate the discount Karen would get if she gets both a manicure and a pedicure:
Discount = 20% of $75 (total cost before discount)
Discount = 0.20 x $75
Discount = $15

2. Subtract the discount from the total cost of both services:
Total cost after discount = $75 - $15
Total cost after discount = $60

3. Add the cost of nail art to the total cost of both services:
Total cost with nail art = $60 + ($3 x 10 (number of fingers))
Total cost with nail art = $60 + $30
Total cost with nail art = $90

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknown speeds. Let's call the speed of the thingamabob "x".
2. According to the problem, the speed of the whirligig is 5 times the speed of the thingamabob, so its speed is 5x.
3. The speed of the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11x.
4. The problem also tells us that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. We can convert this to meters per second by dividing by 3.6, since there are 3.6 seconds in a minute. So the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121/3.6 = 33.33 meters per second.
5. We know that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11x.

1. First, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So, we can set up the equation:

length of one of Topher's shoes = 9 x length of one of Bobby's shoes + 10

2. We also know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. So, we can convert this to inches by dividing by 12:

8 feet and 4 inches = (8 x 12) + 4 = 96 inches

3. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation we found in step 1:

length of one of Topher's shoes = 9 x length of one of Bobby's shoes + 10
length of one of Topher's shoes = 96 x length of one of Bobby's shoes + 10

- I am 2 years older than my sister, so x = y + 2.
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3y - 1.
3. We also know that when we add up all our ages, we get 87: x + y + z + (3y - 1) = 87.

Yellow rope = 37 cm
Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7 cm
Blue rope = 37 cm - 7 cm
Blue rope = 30 cm

2. Now that we know the length of the blue and yellow ropes, we can find the length of the red rope. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, we can multiply the length of the blue rope by 4:

Red rope = 4 x Blue rope
Red rope = 4 x 30 cm
Red rope = 120 cm

Therefore, the length of the red rope was 120 centimeters.</s>

1. Let's start by assigning variables to each person's age. Let's say Peter's age is "P", Paul's age is "P+10" (since he is 10 years older than John), and John's age is "J".

2. We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. So we can set up the equation:

P + (P+10) + J = 100

3. Simplifying the equation:

2P + 10 + J = 100
2P = 90
P = 45

4. Now that we know Peter's age is 45, we can find John's age by subtracting 10 from Paul's age:

J = P - 10
J = 45 - 10
J = 35

5. Finally, we can find Jean's age by adding the ages of Peter, Paul, and John:

Jean = P + (P+10) + J
Jean = 45 + (

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so they used a total of 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

2. Subtract the marshmallows dropped on the ground: 
They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 3 = 32.

3. Divide the number of marshmallows left in the bag by the number of S'mores each kid can have: 
Each kid can have 1 S'more, so they can have a total of 1 + 1 = 2 S'mores.

4. Divide the number of marshmallows left in the bag by the number of S'mores each kid can have:

1. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
2. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.
3. The cost of each bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of each bottle of scotch, so each bottle of cognac costs $600 x 1.5 = $900.
4. The total cost of the cognac is 20 x $900 = $18,000.
5. The total cost of everything is $600 + $18,000 = $18,600.

1. Let's call the smallest angle "x".
2. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x.
3. Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.
4. The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 6x = 180.
6. Dividing both sides by 6, we get: x = 30.
7. Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the largest angle by subtracting it from 180 degrees: 180 - 30 = 150.
8. Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 150 degrees.

2. We know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so we can set up an equation:

x + y = 70

3. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up another equation:

x + y = 20

4. We can solve for "x" by subtracting "y" from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 20

5. Simplifying:

x = 50

Therefore, there are 50 sheep on Lee's farm.</s>

2. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Richie scored x + 20 goals.
3. Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored x + 20 - 45 = x - 25 goals.
4. We know that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can set up an equation: x + (x + 20) + (x - 25) = 80.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x - 25 = 80. Adding 25 to both sides, we get: 3x = 105. Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 35.

- Brownies = 3 x Cupcakes - 2
- Brownies = 3(Cupcakes) - 2
- Brownies = 3C - 2

2. We don't know how many cupcakes Carly made, but we do know that she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So we can set up an equation:

- Cupcakes = 3B - 2
- Cupcakes = 3(Brownies) - 2
- Cupcakes = 3B - 2

3. Now we can substitute the expression we found for the brownies into the equation for the cupcakes:

- Cupcakes = 3(Brownies) - 2
- Cupcakes = 3(3C - 2) - 2
- Cupcakes = 9C - 4

4. We know that each person gets two treats,

2. We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: x = y + 7.
3. We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: y = (1/2)z.
4. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: y = (1/2)z.
5. Solving for z, we get: z = 2y.
6. Substituting this expression for z into the first equation, we get: x = y + 7.

2. From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So we can set up the equation: x = 2y.
3. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So in 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2 and Brooke's age will be y + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (x + 2) + (y + 2) = 28.
4. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: (2y + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28.

2. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So we can write an equation: 5x - 4 = number of blueberry cubes.
3. We also know that the total number of ice cubes Mary makes is 116. So we can write another equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116.
4. Simplifying the second equation, we get: 6x - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides, we get: 6x = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get: x = 20.
5. Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can use the first equation to find the number of blueberry cubes: 5(20) - 4 = 84.
