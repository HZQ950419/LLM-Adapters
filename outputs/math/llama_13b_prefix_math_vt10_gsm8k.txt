1 square foot = 4 square inches
1 square inch = 16 square centimeters

So, 1 sq ft = 16 sq cm

Therefore, 36 sq ft = 36 x 16 sq cm = 576 sq cm

To cover two-thirds of the bathroom, Mr Boarden needs to cover 576 sq cm x 2/3 = 384 sq cm

Since 1 sq cm = 1 mosaic tile, Mr Boarden needs 384 sq cm / 1 sq cm = 384 mosaic tiles

Therefore, Mr Boarden needs 384 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.</s>

1. Let x be the number of CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set.
2. The cost of one CD is $4, so the cost of x CDs would be $4x.
3. Tom paid $48 in total, so we can write an equation:
48 = 4x + cost of headphone set
5. We don't know the cost of the headphone set, so we'll call it y.
6. Solving for x:
4x = 48 - y
7. Simplifying:
4x = 48 - y
4x = 48
x = 48/4
x = 12

Therefore, Tom could have bought 12 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning for 4 weeks, which is a total of 4 x 36 = <<4*36=144>>144 eggs.

Since 1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs, Claire will eat 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

Therefore, Claire will eat 12 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks, which is the same as saying she will eat 12 x 12 = <<12*12=144>>144 eggs in 4 weeks.

1. Let's start by assigning variables to represent the ages of the twins and the triplets. Let x be the age of one of the twins and y be the age of one of the triplets.

2. According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This means that the age difference between the twins and the triplets is 7 years. So we can write:

x = y + 7

3. We also know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. So we can write:

x + y + 7 = 44

4. Now we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides:

x + y + 7 - 7 = 44 - 7

x + y = 37

- Let S be the number of cards Smendrick has
- Let P be the number of cards PJ has

2. From the problem, we know that:
- S = 3P (Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has)
- B = S + 12 (Becca has 12 more than Smendrick)

3. We can use substitution to solve for one of the variables in terms of the others:
- Let S = 3P
- Substituting S = 3P into B = S + 12, we get B = S + 12 = 3P + 12
- Now we can solve for B:

1. Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls.
2. Calvin is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children, so there are a total of 3 adults and 2 children.
3. If everyone eats one bowl at a meal, then Calvin, his wife, and their two children will eat a total of 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 bowls of soup.
4. Since Calvin has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, we can set up an equation: 4a + 8c = 6, where "a" represents the number of adult's bowls used and "c" represents the number of child's bowls used.

1. First, we need to find out how much stuff they have in total:
- 10 people donated 5 boxes each, so they have 10 x 5 = 50 boxes of donated stuff.
- They already have 10 boxes, so they have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes of stuff.

2. Next, we need to find out how many tables they need:
- Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff, so we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2.
- 60 boxes ÷ 2 = 30 tables

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 + 30 = 45 tables.</s>

1. Let x be the cost of the tickets.
2. The cost of the tickets is 50% more than the supplies, which is 0.5x + 0.5($400) = 0.5x + $200.
3. The total cost is the sum of the supplies and the tickets, which is $400 + 0.5x + x = $400 + 0.5x + x.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get $400 + 0.5x = x + $400.
5. Subtracting $400 from both sides, we get 0.5x = x + $400 - $400.

According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so we can write: 

10x = number of copies Marilyn sold 

We also know that the total number of copies sold was 88,000, so we can write: 

x + 10x = 88,000 

Combining like terms:

- M - D = 5 (Marcus is five years younger than Deanna)
3. We can use the second equation to solve for M:
- M = D + 5
- M = 26 + 5
- M = 31
4. Now that we know Marcus' age is 31, we can use the first equation to find Leo's age:

1. First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We can do this by subtracting 5 from 23: 

23 - 5 = 18 

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

2. Next, we need to find out how many potatoes were used to make those 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can do this by dividing the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop: 

18 ÷ 3 = 6 

So, it takes 6 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 

3. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

1. First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. We can do this by dividing the total amount of coal by the amount in each bag: 

850 kg ÷ 50 kg/bag = 17 bags 

So Ali ordered 17 bags of coal. 

2. Next, we need to find out how much each bag costs. We can do this by multiplying the cost per unit by the number of bags: 

$18/bag 

3. Finally, we can find the total cost by multiplying the cost per bag by the number of bags: 

$18/bag x 17 bags = $302 

Therefore, Ali's order costs $302.

1. Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of silver coins Gretchen has. 

According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins is x + 30. 

We also know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 30 = 70 

To solve for x, we can subtract 30 from both sides: 

x + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30 

Simplifying: 

x = 40 

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins. 

To find the total number of coins, we can add the number of silver and gold coins:

3. After George ate 5 candies, he would have had "1/2N - 5" candies left. 

4. We also know that George now has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: 

1/2N - 5 = 3 

5. Solving for N, we can subtract 5 from both sides: 

1/2N = 8

1. Find the discount amount: 
Discount amount = 5% of $140
Discount amount = 5/100 x $140
Discount amount = $7

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price: 
New price = Original price - Discount amount
New price = $140 - $7
New price = $133

Therefore, you will pay $133 after the discount. 

Steps: 
1. Find the discount amount: 
Discount amount = 5% of $140
Discount amount = 5/100 x $140
Discount amount = $7

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price:

5x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 24.2

So a thingamabob spins at 24.2 meters per second.

2. Next, we need to find the speed of a whatchamacallit. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so we can set up another equation:

11(24.2) = 121

To solve for the speed of the whatchamacallit, we can multiply both sides by 11 and then simplify:

1 mile = 5280 feet

Let's call the distance from Elvis's house to the point where he turned around "Distance 1" and the distance from that point to his current location "Distance 2".

We know that:

- Distance 1 = 5 hours x 18 mph = 90 miles
- Distance 2 = 8 hours x 18 mph = 128 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add Distance 1 and Distance 2:

Total distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
Total distance = 90 miles + 128 miles
Total distance = 218 miles

Therefore, Elvis is currently 218 miles from his house.</s>

3/4x = total votes 

3. We also know that the total number of students who voted in the class was 80, so we can substitute that into our equation: 

3/4x = 80 

4. Solving for x: 

x = 80 * (1/4)

Let x be the number of students at the grade level. 

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, so we can write: 

3/4x = number of students with desktop computers 

We also know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so we can write: 

x - 20 = total number of students 

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for x: 

3/4x = number of students with desktop computers 

x - 20 = total number of students 

3/4x - 20 = total number of students 

Multiplying both sides by 4/3: 

x = total number of students + 20

1. To find the total number of points Jane needs to pass, we add the points from her first and second tests: 

15 + 18 = 33 

2. We know that Jane needs a total of at least 42 points to pass, so we can set up an inequality: 

33 ≥ 42 

3. To solve for the minimum number of points Jane needs to score on the third test, we can subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality: 

42 - 33 = 9 

4. Therefore, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on the third test to pass. 

The answer is: 

9 points.</s>

According to the problem, Paisley ran 4 miles. 

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 5 x 4 = 20 miles. 

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran x - 3 miles. 

We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

4 + 20 + (x - 3) = total distance run 

4 + 20 + x - 3 = total distance run 

24 + x - 3 = total distance run

1 dozen = 12 eggs
So, Rozanne used 4 x 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs
She also used 2 more eggs
So, the total number of eggs used is 48 + 2 = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs
To make 5 glasses of eggnog, you need 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 eggs
Therefore, the total number of eggs needed for all the glasses of eggnog is 50 x 25 = <<50*25=1250>>1250 eggs

To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray:

Let L be the number of hot dogs Luke ate. 
Let T be the number of hot dogs Thomas ate. 
Let J be the number of hot dogs John ate. 

2. From the problem, we know that: 
- Luke ate 2 hot dogs. 
- Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so T = 3L. 
- John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so J = (1/2)T = (1/2)(3L) = 1.5L.

8 feet/hour ÷ 1 hour = 8 feet/hour 

So, it will take Bill 8 hours to dig through the clay. 

3. Finally, we can add the time it will take Bill to dig through the soil and the time it will take him to dig through the clay: 

4 hours + 8 hours = 12 hours 

Therefore, it will take Bill 12 hours to dig the well. 

The answer is: 12 hours.</s>

1. Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of bugs in the garden. 

According to the problem, there are half as many bugs as ants, so: 

x = (1/2) * 50 

x = 25 

So there are 25 bugs in the garden. 

To find the total number of insects, we need to add the number of ants and the number of bugs: 

Total number of insects = number of ants + number of bugs 

Total number of insects = 50 + 25 

Total number of insects = 75 

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

Number of rabbits = 60 + Number of cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 60 + 2(Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = 60 + 2(Number of cats)

1. Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, which means she can run at 4 x 1 = 4 miles per hour.
2. She can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, which means she can skip at 4 x 0.5 = 2 miles per hour.
3. If she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, then she will spend 1/3 x 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 x 6 = 4 hours walking.
4. Therefore, she can travel 4 + 2 = 6 miles in six hours.

1. Let's call the amount of red paint "x".
2. We know that the amount of red, white, and purple paint is equal, so the amount of white paint is also "x".
3. We also know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is "x/2".
4. The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, so we can set up an equation:
x + x + (x/2) + 0 = 12
5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x/2 = 12
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 6

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's call the number of red blocks "x".
2. We know that there are 4 blue blocks, so the number of blue blocks is 4.
3. We also know that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 4 x 2 = 8.
4. We know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, so we can set up an equation: 4 + 8 + x = 32
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + x = 32
6. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: x = 20

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.</s>

According to the problem, Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. So we can write an equation: 

Handbag cost = 3x - 20 

We also know that the cost of Jillian's shoes is $80, so we can substitute that into the equation: 

Handbag cost = 3(80) - 20 

Handbag cost = 240 - 20 

Handbag cost = 220

1. First, we need to find out how much meat Prince can sell in one day:
15 kg/hour x 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

2. Next, we need to find out how much meat is in the bull:
750 kg

3. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from the bull, we need to divide the total amount of meat in the bull by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
750 kg ÷ 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull. The answer is 5.</s>

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let x be the number of books Fawn has.
2. According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has x + 25 books.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.
4. We know that the three of them have a total of 85 books, so we can set up an equation: x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 4x + 57 = 85

x + (20 - x) = 70

3. Simplifying the equation:

x + 20 - 2x = 70

1. Let's start by finding out how many cows Farmer Brown has. We know that he has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can set up an equation:

Chickens = 2 * Cows

We can solve for Cows by dividing both sides by 2:

Cows = Chickens / 2

Cows = Chickens / 2

Cows = 60 / 2

Cows = 30

So Farmer Brown has 30 cows.

2. Now we can add up the number of legs of all the animals:

Chickens + Cows = Legs

Chickens = 60

Cows = 30

Legs = Chickens + Cows

Legs = 60 + 30

1. Find the total number of toothpicks Melanie has collected so far: 
10 toothpicks/week x 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks 

2. Subtract the total number of toothpicks Melanie has collected from the required number of toothpicks: 
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks 

3. Divide the remaining number of toothpicks by the rate at which Melanie is collecting them: 
80 toothpicks ÷ 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks 

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks.

1. First, we need to find the speed of the second car when it passes the first car. We can do this by subtracting the speed of the first car (60 mph) from the speed of the second car (70 mph): 

70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph 

So the second car was traveling 10 mph faster than the first car when it passed it. 

2. Next, we need to find the speed of both cars after they passed each other. We can do this by adding their speeds together: 

60 mph + 70 mph = 130 mph 

So both cars are traveling at a speed of 130 mph after they passed each other.

- Jeff is 10 years older than Martha: J = M + 10 
- Martha is 4 years younger than Mike: M = P - 4 
- Mike is 24 years old: P = 24 

Now we can substitute the values we know into the equations:
