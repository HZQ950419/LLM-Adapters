Let's call the number of players on Katie's team "x". 

We know that Katie scored 4 points, and everyone else scored 4 points each, so the total number of points scored by everyone else is 4x. 

We also know that the team scored a total of 12 points, so we can set up an equation: 

4 (Katie's points) + 4x (points scored by everyone else) = 12 

Simplifying: 

4 + 4x = 12 

Subtracting 4 from both sides: 

4x = 8 

Dividing both sides by 4: 

x = 2
