1. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so it jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
2. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so it jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.
3. To find how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: 49 - 19 = 30.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.</s>

1. Identify the given information:
- There are 402 more girls than boys in the school.
- There are 739 girls in the school.

2. Use the given information to set up an equation:
Let x be the number of boys in the school.
Then, the number of girls in the school is x + 402 (since there are 402 more girls than boys).
And we know that there are 739 girls in the school, so we can set up the equation:
x + 402 = 739

3. Solve for x:
Subtract 402 from both sides of the equation:
x + 402 - 402 = 739 - 402
x = 337

Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school.</s>
