1. Identify the given information:
- There are 402 more girls than boys in the school.
- There are 739 girls in the school.

2. Use the given information to set up an equation:
Let x be the number of boys in the school.
Then, the number of girls in the school is x + 402 (since there are 402 more girls than boys).
And we know that there are 739 girls in the school, so we can set up the equation:
x + 402 = 739

3. Solve for x:
Subtract 402 from both sides of the equation:
x + 402 - 402 = 739 - 402
x = 337

Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school.</s>
