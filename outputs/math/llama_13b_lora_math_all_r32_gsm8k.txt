1. Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of the twins and triplets. Let x be the age of one triplet, and y be the age of one twin.

2. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so y = x + 7.

3. We also know that their combined ages are 44, so we can set up an equation: x + (x + 7) = 44

4. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 7 = 44

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

9PJ = Becca + 36

Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get:

6PJ = Becca

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

Becca = 10

So Smendrick has 3 x 10 = 30 cards.

2. Now we can find out how many cards Becca has. We know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so:

Becca = Smendrick + 12

1. Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation "x".
2. We know that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, so the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.
3. We also know that there are 33 people on the council, so the total number of votes is 33.
4. We can set up an equation: x + 2x = 33
5. Simplifying the equation: 3x = 33
6. Solving for x: x = 11
7. Therefore, there were 11 votes against the new regulation.
8. To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can use the equation we set up in step 2: 2x = 33
9. Solving for x: x = 16.5

1. Let's call the number of miles Brian will walk in seven days "x".
2. In seven days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, so she will walk 2x miles.
3. We know that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, so in seven days, she will walk 10 x 7 = 70 miles.
4. We also know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, so we can set up an equation: 2x = 70.
5. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 35.

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.</s>

1. Let's start by finding out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. We know that he used up 45% of the chalk, so we can set up the equation:

0.45x = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 11.25

So the teacher used up 11.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

2. Now we need to figure out how much chalk the teacher will use each day going forward. We know he wants to use only 20% of the chalk each day, so we can set up the equation:

0.2x = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 25

So the teacher will use up 25 inches of chalk each day going forward.

3. Finally, we need to figure out how many days the teacher will have before he has to recycle the chalk. We know that he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, so we can set up the equation:

Marcus's age = 1/2 Leo's age

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can set up another equation:

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

(1/2 Leo's age) = Deanna's age - 5

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

Leo's age = 2(Deanna's age - 5)

Substituting Deanna's age of 26 into the equation, we get:

Leo's age = 2(26 - 5)

Leo's age = 26

Therefore, Leo is 26 years old.</s>

3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so he retrieved (x + 4)/2 balls in the third set.
4. The total number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in all three sets is 19, so we can set up an equation: x + (x + 4) + ((x + 4)/2) = 19
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 7 = 19

To find the perimeter of the room, we need to add up all four sides:
Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(9 + width)
Perimeter = 18 + 2(width)

Substituting the length of the room, we get:
Perimeter = 18 + 2(9 + width)
Perimeter = 18 + 18 + 2(width)
Perimeter = 36 + 2(width)

Simplifying, we get:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lemons: 

7 lemons/year x $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year 

2. Calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree: 

$90 + ($3/year x number of years) = $90 + $30 = $120 

3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the break-even point: 

$10.50/year - $120 = -$104.50 

4. Divide the break-even point by the revenue per year to find the number of years it will take to break even: 

-$104.50 / $10.50/year = 10 years 

Therefore, it will take 10 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.</s>

1. Let's call the initial charge of the power bank "x".
2. We know that the power bank was losing 9% of its charge each hour, so after 5 hours, it would have lost 45% of its charge (0.9x * 5 = 4.5x).
3. After that, the power bank started losing 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, so it would have lost 21% of its charge (0.7x * 3 = 2.1x).
4. Therefore, the total amount of charge lost is 4.5x + 2.1x = 6.6x.
5. We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours was 28%, so we can set up an equation: 0.28 = 0.9x.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 3.125.
7. Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank was 3.125.

2. We also know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so we can set up another equation:

speed of whatchamacallit = 11 x speed of thingamabob

3. We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can substitute this value into the second equation:

121 = 11 x speed of thingamabob

4. Solving for the speed of a thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

speed of thingamabob = 110 meters per second

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20

So Julia had to row back 200 feet (20 x 10 feet) to reach shore.

2. Next, we need to find out how long it took Julia to row back to shore. We know that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can calculate how long it would take her to row back 200 feet:

200 feet / 20 feet per second = 10 seconds

So it would take Julia 10 seconds to row back to shore.

18 - 10 = 8 

Melanie is currently 8 years old. 

2. Now we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age. Let's call this number "x". 

In x years, Melanie's age will be 3 times her present age: 

3(8) = 24 

So, in x years, Melanie will be 24 years old. 

3. Finally, we can set up an equation to solve for x: 

3(8) = 24 

Divide both sides by 3: 

8 = x 

Therefore, it will take x = 8 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.

2. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So we can write:

Topher's shoe length = 9x + 10

3. We also know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. So we can convert this to inches:

8 feet = 96 inches
4 inches = 4/12 of a foot

So the total length of one of Topher's shoes is:

8 feet + 4 inches = 96 + 4 = 100 inches

4. Now we can substitute this value into our equation for Topher's shoe length:

Topher's shoe length = 9x + 10
Topher's shoe length = 100

- I am 2 years older than my sister, so z = x + 2
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so (mom's age) = (3 * brother's age) - 1

3. We also know that when we add all our ages, we get 87:
x + y + z + (mom's age) = 87

4. Now we can substitute the expressions we found for x, y, and z into the equation:

Yellow rope = 37 cm - 7 cm = 30 cm
Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7 cm = 30 cm - 7 cm = 23 cm

2. We also know that the red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so we can multiply the length of the blue rope by 4 to find the length of the red rope:

Red rope = 4 x Blue rope
Red rope = 4 x 23 cm
Red rope = 92 cm

1. Let's start by finding out how many books Ahmed read in one hour. We know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, so:
Ahmed = Ezra/2
Ahmed = 300/2
Ahmed = 150

2. Now we know that Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. We also know that Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so:
Ezra = Ahmed + 150
Ezra = 150 + 150
Ezra = 300

3. Finally, we know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour. Therefore, the total number of books they read altogether is:
Total = Ezra + Ahmed
Total = 300 + 150
Total = 450

Therefore, they read 450 books altogether.</s>

Total cherries = 40 + Jerry's cherries + 30
Total cherries = 70 + Jerry's cherries

3. We also know that 40% of the students in each class are girls, so we can set up another equation:

0.4g = 0.4b

4. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

0.4(g + b) = 0.4b

5. Simplifying the right side of the equation:

0.4g + 0.4b = 0.4b

6. Subtracting 0.4b from both sides:

0.4g = 0.4b

5. Now, we can find the percentage of total work time spent editing by dividing the time spent editing by the total work time and multiplying by 100: (90/6.5) x 100 = 13.64.
6. Since we can't have a percentage greater than 100, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Carol spent 13.64% of her total work time editing the song.

Answer: Carol spent 13.64% of her total work time editing the song.</s>

1. Let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

2. We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 x 2 = 44 seashells.

3. To find out how many seashells they gathered in total, we add up their collections: 27 + 22 + 44 = 93 seashells.

4. To divide the seashells equally among themselves, we divide the total by the number of people: 93 รท 3 = 31.

Therefore, each person got 31 seashells.</s>

3. Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum, so the total cost of the grape gum is 2.
4. Suzie paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum, so the cost of the green apple gum is 0.5x.
5. Suzie paid a total of $7, so we can set up an equation: 2x + 2 + 0.5x = 7.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 4x + 2 = 7.

2. We also know that Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, so if Jamal has 12 apples, then he has 12 / 2 = 6 bananas.

3. Now that we know how many apples and bananas Jamal has, we can find out how many fruits there are in total. Jamal has 12 + 6 = 18 fruits.

4. Finally, we know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Jamal has 12 apples, then Andrea has 12 + 8 = 20 apples.

5. Therefore, the total number of fruits is 18 + 20 = 38.

Answer: There are 38 fruits in total.</s>

1. Let's start by finding the age of the older brother. We know that one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. Let's call the age of the older brother "x".

2. We also know that all sisters are the same age, which is 16. So the total age of the sisters is 16 x 3 = 48.

3. The total age of all siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. Therefore, the total age of all siblings is x + 48.

4. We know that one of the brothers is 12 years old, so we can substitute x = 12 into the equation.

5. Plugging in the values, we get the total age of all siblings as 12 + 48 = 60.

Therefore, the total age of all siblings is 60.</s>

1. Let's start by finding the total number of minutes in the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the equation:

20 x (1/2) = total minutes

Simplifying this equation, we get:

10 = total minutes

So there are a total of 10 minutes in the show.

2. Now we can find the number of episodes in the show by dividing the total minutes by the minutes per episode:

10 / 20 = number of episodes

Simplifying this equation, we get:

5 = number of episodes

Therefore, John will spend 10 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode. The answer in Arabic numerals is 10.</s>

According to the problem, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as: 

W = 5(C + 7) 

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as: 

C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25) 

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 

C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25) 

C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25) 

C = (1/3)(W + 25) - 25

Time = 5 months 

Interest = $3,650 x 10% x 5

Monthly Payment = Principal + Interest 

Principal = $3,650 
Interest = $182.50 

Monthly Payment = $3,650 + $182.50

3. The total number of treats Carly made is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies: x + (3x - 2) = 4x - 2.
4. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats needed is 5 x 2 = 10.
5. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 4x - 2 = 10.
6. Adding 2 to both sides: 4x = 12.
7. Dividing both sides by 4: x = 3.

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.</s>

2nd fastest car = average car x 5
2nd fastest car = 120 x 5
2nd fastest car = 600

2. Now we know that the 2nd fastest car can go 600 miles per hour. We also know that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so:

Faster car = 2nd fastest car x 1.25
Faster car = 600 x 1.25

15 customers / 25 telephone calls per customer = 0.6 telephone calls per customer

2. Now we need to find out how many customers he needs to get to sell 15 cars. We know that for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, he needs to get:

15 cars / 2 customers per car = 7.5 customers

3. Finally, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 7.5 customers. We know that for every 25 telephone calls he makes, he gets one person to come into the car dealership. So, to get 7.5 customers, he needs to make:

S + B = 28

(S + 2B) = 28

3S + 2B = 28

3. Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers during the first week of his trip.
4. During the second week of his trip, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, so he traveled a total of 300 x 7 = 2100 kilometers.
5. Therefore, Tom made a total of 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

- Regina wrote 9 novels last year.
- This is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year.

2. Translate the information into a mathematical equation:
Let's call the number of novels Regina wrote this year "x".
According to the problem, we know that:
9 = (3/4)x

3. Solve for x:
To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3:
9 * 4/3 = x

- The third level has a square footage of 8/2 = 4
- The fourth level has a square footage of 4/2 = 2
- The total square footage of the sandcastle is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 20

2. To find the average square footage of a level, we need to divide the total square footage of the sandcastle by the number of levels:
- Total square footage of the sandcastle = 20
- Number of levels = 4
- Average square footage of a level = Total square footage of the sandcastle / Number of levels
- Average square footage of a level = 20 / 4 = 5

Let x be Sam's current age. 

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's age is 6x. 

In 9 years, Ruby will be 6x + 9 years old. 

The problem also tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can set up an equation: 

6x + 9 = 3(x + 9) 

Simplifying: 

6x + 9 = 3x + 27 

Subtracting 9 from both sides: 

5x = 27 

Dividing both sides by 5: 

x = 5

- Stan caught y Pokemon
- Alex caught z Pokemon
- Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so z = y + 5
- Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so y = 4x - 13

1. Find the distance Matteo traveled: 

distance = rate x time 
distance = 55 mph x 4 hours 
distance = 220 miles 

2. Find the distance Shandy traveled: 

distance = rate x time 
distance = 45 mph x 10 hours 
distance = 450 miles 

3. Find the difference in distance: 

distance difference = distance Shandy traveled - distance Matteo traveled 
distance difference = 450 miles - 220 miles 
distance difference = 230 miles

1. Let's call the cost of each additional phone "x".
2. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.
3. The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.
4. Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is 2x + 5x = 7x.
5. We know that the cost of the main phone is $20, so we can set up an equation: 2x = 20.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 10.
7. Therefore, the cost of each additional phone is $10.
8. The total cost of the phone plan is 7x = 7(10) = $70.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $70.</s>
