1. Let's start by finding the breadth of the rectangular piece. We know that the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, so we can set up the equation:

length = 4 * breadth + 1

2. We can use this equation to solve for the breadth:

breadth = length - 1
breadth = 150 - 1
breadth = 149

3. Now that we know the length and breadth of the rectangular piece, we can find the perimeter by multiplying them together:

perimeter = 2 * length + 2 * breadth
perimeter = 2 * 150 + 2 * 149
perimeter = 300 + 298
perimeter = 698

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular

1. Let the total number of children in the row be x.
2. Neha is 12th from left end, so the number of children between Neha and the left end is x - 12 = x - 1.
3. Radha is 6th from right end, so the number of children between Radha and the right end is x - 6 = x - 1.
4. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places, the number of children between Radha and the left end becomes x - 1 + 2 = x - 1.
5. When Neha is shifted to right by 2 places, the number of children between Neha and the right end becomes x - 1 + 2 = x - 1.
6. Therefore, the number of children between Radha and Neha is x - 1 - 1 = x - 2.

100% - 20% = 80%
                80% of the original price is the discounted price.

To make up for the discount, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 80% of the discounted price.

80% of 20% = 16%

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 16% to make up for the discount.

The answer is (E) 18%.

Steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price by subtracting the discount from the original price: 100% - 20% = 80%
2. Calculate the increase in price needed to make up for the discount: 80% of 20% = 16%

1. Find the total surface area of the rectangular solid by multiplying the length by the width by the height: 3 x 4 x 15 = 108 square units.
2. Since the rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the volume of the solid is equal to the volume of the sphere. The volume of the sphere is 4/3πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere.
3. Set up an equation for the volume of the rectangular solid in terms of the volume of the sphere: 108 = 4/3πr³
4. Solve for r: 108 = 4/3πr³ ÷ 108 = 4/3πr²

2. We know that M and N are three-digit numbers, so a + b + c = 3.

3. We also know that M - N + 396c = 990, so we can substitute a, b, and c into this equation:

a(1000000 - 100000 + 396c) + b(1000000 - 100000 + 396c) + c(1000000 - 100000 + 396c) = 990

The total weight of the 10 oarsmen before replacing the 53 kg man is:

After replacing the 53 kg man with a new man, the total weight of the 10 oarsmen becomes:

10 x (53 + 1.8 kg) = 10 x 54.8 kg = 548 kg

To find the weight of the new man, we need to subtract the weight of the 10 oarsmen before replacing the 53 kg man from the total weight of the 10 oarsmen after replacing the 53 kg man:

548 kg - (10 x 53 kg) = 548 kg - 530 kg = 18 kg

Let's convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per minute:

20 km/h = (20 x 1000) / (60 x 60) = 16.67 meters/minute

Now we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

For the worker driving to work:

time = distance / speed = (9 x 1000) / (16.67) = 54 minutes

For the worker cycling to work:

x = 0.004y * m

where m is a percentage.

2. Now we need to find what percentage of x is m. We can do this by dividing m by the percentage that x is of 4y:

m/0.004y = 1

Multiplying both sides by 4y gives us:

m = 0.004y * 4y = 0.016y

So m is 0.016% of x.

2. The base of the given triangle is the distance between any two vertices. In this case, the distance between (a,0) and (x,y) is x, and the distance between (a,0) and (b,0) is b. Therefore, the base is given by:
Base = x + b

3. The height of the triangle is given by the distance between (a,0) and (x,y), which is y. Therefore, the height is given by:
Height = y

4. Substituting the values of base and height into the formula for area, we get:
Area = 1/2 * (x + b) * y

5. Simplifying the expression, we get:
Area = 1/2 * (x^2

1 mile is equal to 5,280 feet.

Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, which means she travels 10 x 5,280 = 52,800 feet per hour.

Together, they travel 52,800 + 105,600 = 158,400 feet per hour.

To find out how long it will take them to travel 1 mile, we divide 158,400 by their combined speed:

(k-1)x + x + (k-1)x + ... + x + (k-1)x = 51

Simplifying this equation, we get:

kx = 51

Dividing both sides by k, we get:

x = 51/k

We know that the smallest integer in the sequence is -50, so x = -50. Plugging this into the equation above, we get:

-50/k = 51/k

1. Let's assume that there are x students in the school.
2. 20% of x students took physics, which means 0.2x students took physics.
3. Similarly, 28% of x students took math, which means 0.28x students took math.
4. We know that the total number of students who took physics or math is 0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x.
5. Since the total number of students in the school is x, the number of students who did not take physics or math is 1 - 0.48x = 0.52x.
6. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 0.52x.

Since one of the integers is 350, we can write it as 11q, where q is a positive integer. 

The other integer can be written as 11r, where r is also a positive integer. 

Since the least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700, we can write: 

11q * 11r = 7700 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

To make the new price 100% again, we need to increase it by 30%, which is:

100% - 30% = 70% + 30% = 100%

Therefore, we need to increase the new price by:

To find out the percentage increase needed, we divide 30% by 100%, which gives us:

The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given by P = 2(L + W) = 2(x + y) metres.

Since the perimeter is given as 340 metres, we have 2(x + y) = 340. Solving this equation, we get x + y = 170.

Therefore, the area of the plot is A = xy = 170 * 1 = 170 square metres.

The cost of gardening the plot at the rate of 10 per square metre is given by C = A * 10 = 170 * 10 = 17

7/8 of a number = (7/8)x
7/18 of a number = (7/18)x
Given, (7/8)x = (7/18)x + 770
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770
(1/2)x - (1/9)x = 770
(1/2)x + (1/9)x = 770
(1/2)x = 770 + (1/9)x
(1/2)x = 770 + 80
(1/2)x = 850
x = 850/2

1. The probability of catching the first train from the main line is 10 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.1667 or 16.67%.
2. The probability of catching the first train from the harbor line is 10 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.1667 or 16.67%.
3. The probability of catching the first train from either line is the sum of the probabilities: 0.1667 + 0.1667 = 0.3333 or 33.33%.
4. Therefore, the probability of catching the first train is 33.33%.</s>

1. Let's assume that the monthly sales of the shop assistant is "x".
2. According to the problem, her monthly salary is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.
3. Therefore, her monthly salary can be represented as:

S = 500 + 0.05x

4. We are given that her monthly salary should be $1500.
5. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

500 + 0.05x = 1500

6. Solving for "x", we get:

x = 12000

7. Therefore, the monthly sales of the shop assistant should be $12000 to ensure that her monthly salary reaches $1500.

1. The number of possible outcomes for flipping a coin 20 times is 2^20 = 4^20 = 4^21 = 16,777,216.
2. Since neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any amount, the number of outcomes in which the coin landed on Heads is the same as the number of outcomes in which the coin landed on Tails.
3. Therefore, the number of times the coin landed on Heads is 16,777,216/2^20 = (16,777,216)/4^20 = (16,777,216)/4^21 = 16.</s>

1. Probability of Alan guessing correctly: 1/5
2. Probability of Roger cheating: 2/3
3. Probability of Peter getting the answer correct: 5/6
4. Probability of Alan, Roger, and Peter all answering correctly: (1/5) x (2/3) x (5/6) = 2/9
5. Probability of at least one of them answering correctly: 1 - (1/9) = 8/9
6. Probability of at least one of them answering correctly, but not via cheating: (8/9) x (1 - (2/3) - (5/6)) = (8/9) x (1/3) = 23/90

Therefore, the answer is (E) 23/90.</s>

5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 can be simplified to 5 + (?) × 19 - 15 - 7 = 5 + (? × 19) - 15 - 7
Simplifying further, we get 5 + (? × 19) - 15 - 7 = 5 + (? × 19) - 22
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 5 + (? × 19) - 22 = 7
Dividing both sides by 19, we get 5 + (? × 19) = 22 + 7
Multiplying both sides by 19, we get 5 + (? × 19) = 367
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 5 + (? × 19) = 36

1. A travels 3 km towards south.
2. A travels 5 km towards east.
3. A travels 3 km towards north.
4. A travels 2 km towards west.

Total distance traveled by A = 3 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 13 km

To find the distance from A's current location to his home, we need to subtract the total distance traveled by A from the total distance between his current location and his home.

Total distance between A's current location and his home = 13 km

Distance from A's current location to his home = Total distance between A's current location and his home - Total distance traveled by A

Distance from A's current location to his home = 13 km - 13 km

Distance from A's current location to his home = 0

The first part of the problem tells us that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. This can be written as:

x men working x hours per day can do 1 unit of work in 1 day

Now we need to use this information to find out how much work y men working y hours per day can do in y days. We can set up an equation:

y men working y hours per day can do 1 unit of work in y days

We know that:

x men working x hours per day can do 1 unit of work in x days

So we can equate the two expressions:

x men working x hours per day can do 1 unit of work in x days = y men working y hours per day can do 1 unit of work in y days

Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get:

x men
