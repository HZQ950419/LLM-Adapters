To find out how many pastries Wendy sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she baked:

Total pastries = cupcakes + cookies
Total pastries = 41 + 31
Total pastries = 72

Pastries sold = Total pastries - Pastries taken back home
Pastries sold = 72 - 32
Pastries sold = 40

Therefore, Wendy sold 40 pastries at the bake sale.</s>

We know that the total number of points scored by the team is 12, so we can set up an equation:

4(number of players - 1) + 4 + 4 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4(number of players - 1) = 8
