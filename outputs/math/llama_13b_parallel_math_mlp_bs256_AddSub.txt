To find the total number of acres the prairie covers, we need to add the number of acres covered by the dust storm to the number of acres left untouched.

Total number of acres = Acres covered by dust storm + Acres left untouched
Total number of acres = 64535 acres + 522 acres
Total number of acres = 65057 acres

Therefore, the prairie covers 65057 acres.</s>
