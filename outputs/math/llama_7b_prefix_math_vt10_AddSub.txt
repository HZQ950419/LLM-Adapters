1 gallon = 3.237 cubic feet

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water in the bucket.
3 gallons + 6.8 gallons = 9.8 gallons

Step 2: Convert the total amount of water from gallons to cubic feet.
9.8 gallons x 3.237 cubic feet/gallon = 32 cubic feet

Therefore, there will be 32 cubic feet of water in all. The answer in cubic feet is 32.</s>

To solve the problem, we need to subtract the number of games the team lost from the total number of games played:

Total number of games played = 12
Number of games defeated = 4
Number of games won = Total number of games - Number of games defeated
Number of games won = 12 - 4
Number of games won = 8

To find out how many peaches Mike picked, we need to subtract the initial number of peaches from the final number of peaches.

Initial number of peaches = 34
Final number of peaches = 86

Subtracting the initial number of peaches from the final number of peaches, we get:

86 - 34 = 52

Therefore, Mike picked 52 peaches.

The steps are:

1. Initial number of peaches = 34
2. Final number of peaches = 86
3. Subtract the initial number of peaches from the final number of peaches: 86 - 34 = 52

Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the amount of money Keith made washing cars. 

According to the problem, last week Tim had 12 dollars and Keith had 36 dollars. 

So we can write an equation: 

12x + 36 = 75 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

First, we'll add 36 to both sides: 

12x + 36 + 36 = 75 + 36 

Simplifying: 

48x = 111 

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 48: 

x = 2 

Therefore, Keith made 2 dollars washing cars.

Let x be the initial value of Kate 's retirement fund. 

According to the problem, the fund decreased by $ 12 , so we can write: 

x - 12 = 1472 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 12 from both sides: 

x - 12 - 12 = 1472 - 12 

Simplifying: 

x - 12 = 1460 

Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 12: 

x = 120

To find the total number of pears picked, we need to add the number of pears picked by Sara and Tim. 

Total number of pears picked = Number of pears picked by Sara + Number of pears picked by Tim 

We know that Sara picked 6 pears and Tim picked 5 pears, so: 

Total number of pears picked = 6 + 5 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

Total number of pears picked = 11

Let's use "x" to represent the number of books the library had before the grant.

According to the problem, the Silvergrove Public Library used a grant to purchase 2647 books. So we can set up the equation:

x + 2647 = 8582

To solve for x, we can subtract 2647 from both sides:

x = 8582 - 2647

Simplifying:

x = 5935

Therefore, the library had 5935 books before the grant. The answer in Arabic numerals is 5935.</s>

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of puppies Alyssa had to start with. 

According to the problem, she gave 7 puppies to her friends, so she now has x - 7 puppies left. 

We also know that she now has 5 puppies, so we can set up the equation: 

x - 7 = 5 

To solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides: 

x - 7 + 7 = 5 + 7 

Simplifying: 

x = 12 

Therefore, Alyssa had 12 puppies to start with.

Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the amount of money Fred made washing cars. 

According to the problem, before washing cars, Fred had 23 dollars and Jason had 46 dollars. So we can write an equation: 

23 + x = 46 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 23 from both sides: 

x + 23 = 46 - 23 

Simplifying: 

x = 23 

So Fred made 23 dollars washing cars. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Fred made 23 dollars washing cars. (23)</s>

We also know that Sam had 8 puppies with spots, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 8

To solve for "x", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2:

To solve the problem, we need to subtract the number of pencils Sally took out from the total number of pencils in the drawer.

Total number of pencils in the drawer = 9

Number of pencils Sally took out = 4

Number of pencils left in the drawer = Total number of pencils in the drawer - Number of pencils Sally took out

Number of pencils left in the drawer = 9 - 4

Number of pencils left in the drawer = 5

Therefore, there are 5 pencils left in the drawer. The answer in Arabic numerals is 5.</s>

According to the problem, Sally had 13 peaches at her roadside fruit dish, but after going to the orchard and picking peaches, she now has 55 peaches.

So we can write an equation:

13 + x = 55 

To solve for "x", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 13 from both sides:

13 + x - 13 = 55 - 13

x = 42

To find out how tall Tori is now, we need to add the amount she grew to her original height:

4.4 feet + 2.86 feet = 7.26 feet

Therefore, Tori is now 7.26 feet tall.

Steps:
1. Convert Tori's original height to inches: 4.4 feet x 12 inches/foot = 52.8 inches
2. Add the amount she grew: 52.8 inches + 2.86 feet = 55.66 inches
3. Convert the inches back to feet: 55.66 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 4.66 feet

Therefore, Tori is now 4.66 feet tall.

Answer: Tori is now 7.26 feet tall. (7.26)

To find out how many seashells they found together, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells they found.

Total number of seashells = 37 + 13 = 50
Number of cracked seashells = 25

Number of uncracked seashells = Total number of seashells - Number of cracked seashells
Number of uncracked seashells = 50 - 25
Number of uncracked seashells = 25

Therefore, they found 50 seashells together. The answer in Arabic numerals is 50.</s>

1. Let's call the number of gallons of blue paint "x".
2. We know that the total number of gallons of paint used is 6689.
3. We also know that the company used 660 gallons of white paint.
4. To find the number of gallons of blue paint used, we need to subtract the number of gallons of white paint from the total number of gallons of paint used: 

6689 - 660 = x

5. Solving for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 660: 

x = 6689 ÷ 660 ≈ 10

Therefore, the company used 10 gallons of blue paint.
