1. Calculate the area of the bathroom: 
Area = length x width 
Area = 36 sq ft 

2. Calculate the area that needs to be covered with mosaic tiles: 
Area to be covered = 2/3 x Area 
Area to be covered = 2/3 x 36 sq ft 
Area to be covered = 24 sq ft 

Therefore, Mr Boarden would need 24 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. The answer in Arabic numerals is 24.</s>

1. The car in the fast lane traveled for 480 miles at a speed of 60 miles/hour.
2. The car in the slow lane traveled for 480 miles at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 30 miles/hour.
3. To calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can use the formula: time = distance ÷ speed.
4. For the car in the fast lane, time = 480 miles ÷ 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.
5. For the car in the slow lane, time = 480 miles ÷ 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours.</s>

1. Let x be the number of silver coins.
2. According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30.
3. The total number of coins is given as 110. So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 30 = 110.
5. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 2x = 80.
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 40.
7. Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.
8. To find the number of gold coins, we can substitute x = 40 into the expression x + 30: x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.
4. We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:
3x + 12 = 341
5. Solving for x, we get:
x = 341 - 12
x = 330
6. Therefore, PJ has 330 cards.
7. To find how many cards Becca has, we can substitute x = 330 into the expression we found for Becca's cards:
Becca = 3(330) + 12
Becca = 992 + 12
Becca = 1004

Therefore, Becca has 1004 cards.</s>

1. Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation.
2. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the number of votes against it, so the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.
3. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, so we can write an equation: x + 2x = 33.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 33.
5. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 11.
6. Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2(11) = 22.

1. Let's start by finding Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is half of Leo's age and five years younger than Deanna, who is 26. So:

Marcus's age = 1/2 * Leo's age - 5
Marcus's age = 1/2 * 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 13

2. Now that we know Marcus's age, we can find Leo's age. We know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so:

Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 * 13
Leo's age = 26

Therefore, Leo is 26 years old.</s>

2. If only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, then the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. This means that the other person would get 140+15 = <<140+15=155>>155 corn chips.
3. Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 140+155 = <<140+155=295>>295. Answer: \boxed{295}.</s>

1. John's new speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed, so his new speed is 150 x 2.5 = 375 WPM.
2. To find how long it would take John to speak 10 pages with 450 words per page, we can use the formula: time = (number of pages) x (words per page) x (speed).
3. Substituting the given values, we get: time = 10 x 450 x 375 = 37,500 seconds.
4. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the seconds to minutes by dividing by 60: 37,500/60 = 600 minutes.
5. Therefore, it would take John 600 minutes to speak 10 pages with 450 words per page.
6. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 600/60 = 10 hours.

1 yard = 3 feet, so the length of the room is 3 x 3 = 9 feet.
The area of the room is 360 square feet, so we can use the formula:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 9 x 360
Area = 3,120 square feet

To find the perimeter of the room, we can use the formula:
Perimeter = 2 x Area
Perimeter = 2 x 3,120
Perimeter = 6,240 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 6,240 feet.</s>

2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so its cost is 3x.
3. One red car costs $4, so 5 red cars cost 5 x $4 = $20.
4. The total cost of the toys is the sum of the cost of the doll, the cost of the 3 action figures, and the cost of the 5 red cars: 3x + 3(4) + 5(4) = 3x + 12 + 20 = 3x + 32.
5. We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so we can set up an equation: 3x = 3(4) = 12.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 4.
7. Now that we know x = 4, we can substitute it into the equation for the total cost: 3x + 12 + 20 = 3(4) + 12 + 20 = 36 + 20 = 56.

2. According to the problem, the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 5x.
3. The problem also tells us that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11x.
4. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up an equation:

11x = 121

5. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 11

6. Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying it by 5:

5x = 5(11)
5x = 55
x = 11

   Total amount = $750 + $150 = $<<750+150=900>>900

5. Divide the total amount by the number of months (3) to get the monthly payment: 
   Monthly payment = $900 ÷ 3 = $<<900/3=300>>300

Therefore, Shiela will pay $300 each month for 3 months.

1. Let x be the cost of the lot.
2. According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is 3x.
3. We know that the total cost of the house and lot is $120,000, so we can write an equation: 

x + 3x = 120,000 

4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 

4x = 120,000 

5. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 4: 

x = 30,000 

6. Therefore, the cost of the house is 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000.

1. First, we need to find out how old Shawna is. We know that she is three times as old as Aliya, who is 3 years old. So, Shawna is 3 x 3 = 9 years old.
2. Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, if Shawna is 9 years old, then her father is 5 x 9 = 45 years old.

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.</s>

1. First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of 9,300. 

2. To do this, we can use the following proportion: 

9,300 pennies / 1 cup = x pennies / 2 cups 

3. Cross-multiplying, we get: 

9,300 pennies * 2 cups = x pennies * 1 cup 

4. Solving for x, we get: 

x = (9,300 pennies * 1 cup) / 2 cups 

x = 4,650 pennies 

5. Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is: 

4,650 pennies * $0.01 = $46.50

- Bahati's score = B
- Azibo's score = A
- Dinar's score = D

2. We know that Bahati's score is 20 more than Azibo's score, and 10 more than Dinar's score. So we can write an equation:
B = A + 20
B = D + 10

3. We also know that the total score for the team is 45. So we can write another equation:
B + A + D = 45

4. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
(B + 20 + D + 10) + B + A + D = 45

5. Simplifying the equation:
2B + 30 + 2D + 10 = 45

1. Let's start by finding out how many days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car. Since it takes half as many days as the bus, we can divide 6 by 2 to get:

6 ÷ 2 = 3

So it takes 3 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car.

2. Now we need to find out how many days Andrew will travel if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car. To do this, we need to add the number of days he will spend traveling to Rochester by bus to the number of days he will spend traveling back to New Jersey by car. So:

6 (bus travel days) + 3 (car travel days) = 9 days

Therefore, Andrew will travel for 9 days if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car. The answer in Arabic numerals is 9.</s>

Sarah's eggs + 12 = 30 

Sarah's eggs = 18

Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 30 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 26

3. To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

1. Let's start by finding Dana's walking speed. We know that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so if she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then her running speed is 4 miles per hour. Therefore, her walking speed is 1 mile per hour.

2. Now, we need to find out how many miles she can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Let's call the amount of time she spends running "t" and the amount of time she spends walking "6-t".

3. We know that she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so the distance she can run in six hours is:

4t * 4 miles per hour = 16 miles

4. We also know that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so the distance she can skip in six hours is:

2. We also know that the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Half of the mural is yellow, which means that half of the mural is not red, white, or purple.
3. To find out how much paint was used for the red, white, and purple parts of the mural, we need to subtract the amount of paint used for the yellow part from the total amount of paint used.
4. Let x be the amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple parts of the mural.
5. We know that half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of paint used for the yellow part is 1/2 * x.
6. The total amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple parts of the mural is x - 1/2 * x = 1/2 * x.

1. Let's start by finding the weight of the blue beetle. We know that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so if the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, then the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds as well.

2. Next, we know that the pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. The yellow snake weighs 50 pounds, so the pink frog weighs 50 - 10 = 40 pounds.

3. We also know that the pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. The red bird weighs 20 pounds, so the pink frog weighs 50 + 20 = 70 pounds.

4. Finally, we know that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 50 + 50 + 40 + 70 + 20 = 200 pounds.

1. Let's start by finding Noah's age six years ago. We know that six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, Cera was 46 years old. So, Noah was 46/2 = 23 years old six years ago.

2. We also know that six years ago, when Noah was 23 years old, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Let's call the current population of Chile "x". So, six years ago, the population of Chile was x/2.

3. We know that six years ago, when Noah was 23 years old, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we can set up an equation:

x/2 = 3000(23)

4. Simplifying the equation:

x/2 = 72,000

5. Solving for x:

x = 144,000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 144,000.</s>

1. Pauline visits the museum three times a year for 5 years, so she visits the museum 3 x 5 = 15 times.
2. The cost of one visit is $2, so the total cost for 15 visits is 15 x $2 = $30.
3. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, so the new cost of one visit is 150% of $2 = $3.
4. Pauline visits the museum for 3 more years, so she visits the museum a total of 15 + 3 = 18 times.
5. The total cost for 18 visits is 18 x $3 = $54.
6. Therefore, Pauline spent $30 + $54 = $84 on all visits to the museum.

1. Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack, so each bagel costs $1.00.
2. If Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount, which is 0.1 x $10.00 = $1.00.
3. After the discount, each pack of bagels will cost $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.
4. Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, each bagel will cost $9.00 / 9 = $1.00.

Therefore, each single bagel will cost $1.00.</s>

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. On Saturday, the store sold double that number of shoes, which means they sold 14 x 2 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes.
3. On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which means they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
4. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so the store actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of tennis shoes on Sunday.
5. To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we add the number sold on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs of tennis shoes.

Therefore, the store sold 56 pairs of tennis shoes by the end of the sale.</s>

1. Each kid gets a slice that is 1/6 of the watermelon.
2. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, which means each adult gets a slice that is 1/3 of the watermelon.
3. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to divide their slice by the total watermelon and multiply by 100.
4. First, we need to find the total watermelon by adding the slices of all 6 people: 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.
5. Then, we need to find the slice of each adult by multiplying the slice of each kid by 2: 1/6 x 2 = 1/3.
6. Finally, we can find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets by dividing their slice by the total watermelon and multiplying by 100: (1/3 / 1) x 100 = 33.

average speed = total distance ÷ total time 

2. We know that Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, so his average speed is: 

average speed = 110 miles ÷ 2 hours 

average speed = 55 miles per hour 

3. Then, we know that Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, so his total distance is: 

total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles 

total distance = 250 miles 

4. Using the same formula, we can find Sid's average speed for the second leg of the trip: 

average speed = 140 miles ÷ 3 hours 

average speed = 40 miles per hour 

5. To find the average speed for the entire trip, we can add the two average speeds together: 

average speed = 55 miles per hour + 40 miles per hour

Let S be Seth's current age 
Let B be Brooke's current age 

2. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation: 
S = 2B 

3. We also know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: 
(S + B) + 2 = 28 

4. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 
(2B + 2) + 2 = 28 

5. Simplifying the equation: 
3B + 2 = 28 

6. Subtracting 2 from both sides: 
3B = 26 

7. Dividing both sides by 3: 
B = 9 

So Brooke is currently 9 years old. 

To find Seth's current age, we can substitute B = 9 into the first equation:

1. Find the average speed of the Llesis family when they hiked:
- Half their speed when they drove is 50/2 = 25 miles per hour.
- They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their speed, so they hiked at 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

2. Find the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance = Speed x Time
- Distance = 50 miles/hour x 6 hours
- Distance = 300 miles

3. Find the distance they hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 20 miles per hour.

1. Let's start by finding the time it took to cook beans. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, we can use the formula:

time to cook beans = (time to cook pork + time to cook rice) / 2

2. We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so we can substitute that into the formula:

time to cook beans = (30 + time to cook pork) / 2

3. We also know that it took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Let's call the time it took to cook pork "p" and the time it took to cook rice "r":

p = r + 20

4. Substituting this into the formula for beans, we get:

time to cook beans = (30 + p) / 2

5. Now we can substitute the values we know into the formula:

time to cook beans = (30 + p) / 2
time to cook beans = (30 + 20) /

Let x be Adam's age eight years ago. 

According to the problem, we know that: 

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x 

And we also know that: 

Duncan's age now = 60 

So we can set up an equation: 

2x = 60 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: 

x = 30 

So Adam was 30 years old eight years ago. 

2. Now we can use this information to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years. 

In 8 years, Adam will be x + 8 years old. 

So we can set up another equation: 

x + 8 = 30 

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides: 

x = 22 

Therefore, Adam will be 22 years old in 8 years.

2. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags.
3. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers.
4. This means that 20/4 = 5 lorries could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers.
5. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 20 - 5 = 15 tons.

3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, which means that Brittany's phone can hold 50(1800) = 90,000 photographs.
4. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, Jamal's phone can hold 6(90,000) = 540,000 photographs.
5. Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is x = 1800/540,000.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 3

1. Calculate the cost of the coffee: Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The cost of the normal brand of coffee is $5 per pound, so the cost of 7 pounds of coffee is 7 x $5 = $35.

2. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee: The more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the normal brand, so it costs 1.2 x $5 = $6 per pound. The cost of 7 pounds of coffee with the more expensive brand is 7 x $6 = $42.

3. Calculate the total cost: The total cost is the sum of the cost of the normal brand of coffee and the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee: $35 + $42 = $77.

1. Let's start by finding the weight of Elijah's first dog. We know that it is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. So:

Elijah's first dog = 1/4 x 60 = 15 pounds

2. Now we need to find the weight of Elijah's second dog. We know that it is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. So:

Elijah's second dog = 1/2 x 60 = 30 pounds

3. To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we add the weight of his first dog to the weight of his second dog:

Total weight of Elijah's dogs = 15 + 30 = 45 pounds

4. Finally, to find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog:

Total weight of all dogs = 45 + 60 = 105 pounds
