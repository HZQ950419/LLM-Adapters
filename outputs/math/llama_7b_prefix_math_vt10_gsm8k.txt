To solve the problem, we need to use the formula:

height = rate x time

where rate is the growth rate of the bamboo in inches per day, and time is the number of days.

We know that the growth rate of the bamboo is 30 inches per day.

We also know that the height of the bamboo today is 20 feet.

To find out how long it will take for the bamboo's height to be 600 inches, we need to set up the following equation:

600 = rate x time

Substituting the values we know, we get:

600 = 30 x t

Dividing both sides by 30, we get:

t = 20

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bambo

x + y + z = 44

x + (x + 7) + z = 44

1. Let's start by finding out how many silver coins Gretchen has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Gold coins = Silver coins + 30

2. We know that Gretchen has 110 coins total, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Gold coins = 110 + 30

3. Simplifying the equation, we get:

Gold coins = 140

4. Now that we know Gretchen has 140 gold coins, we can find out how many silver coins she has:

Silver coins = 140 - 30

5. Substituting the value of Gold coins into the equation, we get:

Silver coins = 11

1. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
2. Locsin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
3. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
4. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
5. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 - 2 = 1 clownfish.
6. Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 10 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 20 fish.

Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of copies Harald sold. 

According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's first record sold x + 10 copies. 

Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so we can write an equation: 

x + (x + 10) = 88,000 

Simplifying the equation: 

2x + 10 = 88,000 

Subtracting 10 from both sides: 

2x = 87,000 

Dividing by 2: 

x = 43,500 

Therefore, Harald sold

To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to calculate the total time he spends on lunches and breaks and then multiply it by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Step 1: Calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks in 5 days.

Total time = Lunches + Breaks
Total time = 30 + (2 x 15)
Total time = 30 + 30
Total time = 60

Step 2: Multiply the total time by 60 to find out how many hours it adds up to.

Hours = Total time x 60
Hours = 60 x 60

The perimeter of a room is the sum of the lengths of all four sides, so the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is:
Perimeter = 2 x length + width
Perimeter = 2 x 9 + width
Perimeter = 18 + width

Since the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet, we can set up the following equation:
width = (360 / area) x length
width = (360 / 360) x 9

We know that the football team played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost. Let's call the number of games they lost "x". 

According to the problem, we can set up an equation: 

x + 8 = 22 

To solve for "x", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides: 

x + 8 - 8 = 22 - 8 

Simplifying: 

x = 14 

So the football team lost 14 games. 

To find out how many games they won, we can add the number of games they lost to the number of games they won above:

1 dozen = 12 eggs
5 dozens = 5 x 12 = 60 eggs
Price per dozen = $2.40
Price per egg = $1.00
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = $1.00 - $2.40
Profit = -$1.40

Step 1: Calculate the cost price of 60 eggs
Cost Price = Price per dozen x Number of dozens
Cost Price = $2.40 x 5
Cost Price = $12.00

Step 2: Calculate the selling price of 3 eggs
Selling Price = Price per egg x Number of eggs
Selling Price = $1.00 x 3
Selling Price = $3.00

Step 3: Calculate the profit

Let's call the distance between the two trains "d". 

According to the problem, the first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so after 3 hours it will have traveled 60 x 3 = 180 miles. 

The second train is traveling half the speed of the first train, so it is traveling 60/2 = 30 miles per hour. 

After 3 hours, the second train will have traveled 30 x 3 = 90 miles. 

The distance between the two trains is d + 180 + 90 = 270 miles. 

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the cost of one cup. 

According to the problem, 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. So we can write an equation: 

20x - 1200 = 6000x 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 1200 from both sides: 

20x - 1200 - 1200 = 6000x - 1200 

Simplifying: 

18x = 7800 

x = 40 

So the cost of one cup is $40.

x + 3x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 

x = 20 

So the cost of the foot-long fish sub is $20.

I'm sorry for the mistake. Here's the correct solution:

If three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home, then two-thirds of students do not have a desktop computer at home.

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer at home, so we can set up an equation:

2/3 x 20 = 10

So there are 10 students who do not have a desktop computer at home.

To find the total number of students at that grade level, we can add the number of students who have a desktop computer at home to the number of students who do not have a desktop computer at home:

We can start by using the given information to set up an equation:

Movie A = 1/4 Movie B
Movie B = 5 minutes longer than Movie C
Movie C = 1.25 hours

Now we can solve for Movie A by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

Movie A = 1/4 Movie B
Movie B = 5 minutes longer than Movie C
Movie C = 1.25 hours

Now we can solve for Movie B by subtracting 5 minutes from Movie C:

Movie B = 1.25 hours - 5 minutes
Movie B = 1.20 hours

Finally, we can solve for Movie A by multiplying Movie B by 4:

Movie A = 4 x Movie B
Movie A = 4 x 1.20 hours
Movie A = 4.80 hours

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
2. She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, which means she bought 2 x 5 = 10 packs of black pens.
3. To find the total number of pens Alain's mom bought, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 5 + 10 = 15 pens.
4. Since each pack has 5 pens, we divide the total number of pens by 5: 15 รท 5 = 3 pens.

Therefore, Alain's mom bought 3 packs of red pens and 10 packs of black pens, and Alain has a total of 3 + 10 = 13 pens. The answer in Arabic numerals is 13.</s>

2. He caught 4 times that amount on Friday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 pounds.
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.
4. To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we add up the amounts he caught on each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.
5. Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 / 3 = 7 servings of crawfish.

Let x be the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. 

According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 

So we can write an equation: 

x - 40 = 7x 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

First, we'll subtract 40 from both sides: 

x - 40 - 40 = 7x - 40 

Simplifying: 

x = 30 

So Sam had 30 loaves of bread last Friday.

2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so she has $100 + $25 = $125.
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so she has $125 + $50 = $175.
4. To find the total amount all three girls have, we add their individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $490.

Therefore, all three girls have a combined total of $490.</s>

1. Start with the information that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob to shingle a house.
2. Let x be the time it takes Rob to shingle a house.
3. We know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob, so Royce takes 2x + 40 minutes.
4. We also know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob, so we can set up an equation: 2x + 40 = 2(2x) + 40
5. Simplifying the equation: 3x + 40 = 4x + 40
6. Solving for x: 3x = 40
7. Subtracting 40 from both sides: x = 30

2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon.
3. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.
4. To find out how many loaves of bread they had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked.
5. Total loaves baked = 200
Loaves sold = 93
Loaves returned = 6
Loaves left = Total loaves baked - Loaves sold - Loaves returned
Loaves left = 200 - 93 - 6
Loaves left = 101

distance = 51 miles

Now let's use the same formula for Stanley's distance:

distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
distance = 25 miles

To find the total distance, we need to add the two distances:

total distance = 51 miles + 25 miles
total distance = 76 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 76 miles.</s>

2. They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%.
3. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, how much should she give to Benedict?

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the monthly interest: 2% of $100 is equal to $2.
2. Multiply the monthly interest by the number of months: $2 x 3 months = $6.
3. Add the monthly interest to the principal amount: $100 + $6 = $106.

Therefore, Mandy should give $106 to Benedict.</s>

To find out how much James pays a year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

I'm sorry for the mistake. Here's the correct solution:

If the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20, then the total number of animals is 70 + 20 = 90.

Let x be the number of sheep on Lee's farm.
Then the number of geese is 90 - x.

We know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so the number of sheep legs is 70 - x.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so the number of sheep heads is 20 - x.

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

70 - x = sheep legs
20 - x = sheep heads

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

distance = rate x time

where distance is the total distance Jeff walks in a week, rate is the speed at which he walks, and time is the total number of days he works in a week.

We know that Jeff walks 3 miles each way, so the total distance he walks in a day is 3 miles x 2 = 6 miles.

We also know that he works 5 times a week, so the total number of days he works in a week is 5 x 7 = 35 days.

To find the total distance he walks in a week, we can use the formula:

distance = rate x time
distance = 6 miles/day x 35 days/week
distance = 210 miles

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 210 miles in a week

2. To find the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6, we need to use multiplication.
3. Multiplying 3 by 4 gives us 12 (since 3 x 4 = 12).
4. Adding 6 to 12 gives us 18 (since 12 + 6 = 18).
5. Therefore, the floor that's equal to 4 times Bill's starting floor plus 6 is the 18th floor.
6. To find Bill's current floor, we need to subtract 3 from 18.

Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the interest rate, and T is the time period.

We know that Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%, so we can substitute those values into the formula:

I = $3,650 x 0.10 x 5

Simplifying this expression, we get:

I = $182.50

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we can divide the total interest by the number of months to find out how much she has to pay per month:

$182.50 รท 5 = $36.50

Therefore, Karan has to pay $36.50 per month

1. Determine Jerry's current age. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up an equation:

Jerry's current age = 2 * Jerry's age 5 years ago

2. Solve for Jerry's current age:

Jerry's current age = 2 * Jerry's age 5 years ago
Jerry's current age = 2 * 35
Jerry's current age = 70

Therefore, Jerry is currently 70 years old.

3. Use the first equation to find Jerry's age in 3 years:

Jerry's age in 3 years = current age + 3 years
Jerry's age in 3 years = 70 + 3 years
Jerry's age in 3 years = 73

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

Total time = time per dog x number of dogs

We know that John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours per day to walk and take care of their business. So the total time per day that John spends taking care of dogs is:

0.5 hours/dog x 10 dogs = 5 hours/day

To find the total time per week that John spends taking care of dogs, we need to multiply the total time per day by the number of days in a week:

5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of dogs.

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40: 

4x + 8 = 40 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides: 

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 

Simplifying: 

4x = 32 

Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 4:

2 + 1 = 3 

Therefore, Dolly and Pandora have a total of 3 books. 

Next, we need to find out how many times Dolly and Pandora will read each other's books. 

Dolly and Pandora will read each other's books one time each. 

To find out how many times they will read each other's books in total, we multiply the number of times they will read each other's books by the number of books they have:

We also know that Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, so we can plug that in as well:

average speed = 110 miles / 2 hours + 140 miles / 3 hours

Simplifying this expression, we get:

average speed = 110 miles / 2 hours + 140 miles / 3 hours

1. Let's call the number of blue gumballs "b".
2. According to the problem, there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. We can write this as:

p = 4b + 22

3. We also know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can substitute "b" for "12" in the equation:

p = 4(12) + 22
p = 52 + 22
p = 74

4. Now we can find the number of pink gumballs:

p = 74

Therefore, there are 74 pink gumballs. The answer in Arabic numerals is 74.</s>

2. We know that Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. So we can write an equation:

L + D + B = 43

3. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David. So we can write:

L = D + 7

4. We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found. So we can write:

D = 0.5B

2. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.
3. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.
4. After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?

To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to subtract the delivery fees and tip from his final bill:

$40.00 - $3.00 - $4.00 = $23.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries was $23.00.</s>

3. In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10.
4. In 10 years, Marco's age will be y + 10.
5. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + y) + (x + 10) + (y + 10) = 3x + 20.
6. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 3x + 20.
7. We know that their sum of ages now is 20, so we can set up an equation: x + y = 20.
8. Solving for x and y, we get x = 20 - y and y = 20 - x.

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

Total number of posts = Number of members x Average number of posts per day

First, we need to find the average number of posts per day for the group:

Average number of posts per day = Total number of posts / Number of days
Average number of posts per day = 1000 posts / 30 days
Average number of posts per day = 33.33 posts per day

Now, we can use the formula to find the total number of posts in March:

Total number of posts in March = Number of members x Average number of posts per day
Total number of posts in March = 1000 members x 33.33 posts per day
Total number of posts in March = 33333 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled.

Distance Matteo traveled = 55 miles/hour x 4 hours = 220 miles

Distance Shandy traveled = 45 miles/hour x 10 hours = 450 miles

Distance Shandy drove farther than Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The answer in Arabic numerals is: 230.</s>

1. Let's start by finding out how many cookies Cody eats. We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats, so we can set up an equation:

Cody's cookies = 3 x Amir's cookies

2. We also know that Amir eats 5 cookies, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Cody's cookies = 3 x 5

3. Simplifying the equation, we get:

Cody's cookies = 15

4. Therefore, Cody eats 15 cookies.

5. To find out how many cookies both of them eat together, we need to add their individual amounts:

Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies = 15 + 5

6. Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 cookies

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Determine the cost of one additional phone. Since each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone, the cost of one additional phone is $20/2 = $10.
2. Determine the cost of two additional phones. Since each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone, the cost of two additional phones is $10/2 = $5.
3. Determine the cost of five additional phones. Since each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone, the cost of five additional phones is $5/5 = $1.
4. Add up the cost of all the phones to find the total cost of the plan. The total cost of the plan is $20 + $10 + $5 + $1 = $46.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $46.
