1. Let x be the number of hours Tom paid to have the bike checked out.
2. The cost of renting the bike for x hours is 7x dollars.
3. The total cost of renting the bike for x hours is 17 + 7x dollars.
4. We know that Tom paid 80 dollars to rent the bike, so we can set up an equation: 17 + 7x = 80
5. Solving for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides: 7x = 63
6. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 9

Therefore, Tom paid to have the bike checked out for 9 hours.</s>

1. Start with the initial height of the tree, which is 4 feet.
2. Determine the growth rate of the tree, which is 5 feet per year.
3. Divide the desired final height of the tree by the growth rate to find the number of years it will take to reach that height: 29 feet ÷ 5 feet/year = 5.8 years.
4. Since we can't have a fraction of a year, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6 years.

Therefore, it will take 6 years for the tree to be 29 feet tall. The answer in Arabic numerals is 6.</s>

Let's call the three consecutive even numbers "x", "x+2", and "x+4". 

We know that the sum of these three numbers is 162, so we can set up an equation: 

x + (x+2) + (x+4) = 162 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

3x + 6 = 162

1. Let x be the amount of cat food needed for the second cat.
2. The total amount of cat food needed for both cats is 0.5 + x.
3. The problem states that the total amount of cat food needed is 0.9, so we can set up an equation: 0.5 + x = 0.9
4. Solving for x: 0.5 + x = 0.9
5. Subtracting 0.5 from both sides: x = 0.4

Therefore, Jake needs to serve an extra 0.4 of a can of cat food each day to feed the second cat. The answer in Arabic numerals is 0.4.</s>
