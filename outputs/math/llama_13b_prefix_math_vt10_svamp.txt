2. We know that Dave had 11 apps and 3 files, so the total number of items on his phone is A + 3.
3. We also know that Dave deleted some apps and files, so the total number of items on his phone after deleting is A' + 3', where A' is the number of apps he has left and 3' is the number of files he has left.
4. We can set up an equation to represent this information: (A + 3) - (A' + 3') = 24.
5. Simplifying this equation, we get A - A' + 3 - 3' = 24.

1. To solve the problem, we need to subtract the number of candies Frank lost from the total number of candies he had: 

33 - 24 = 9 

2. Since Frank had 9 pieces of candy left, he put them into bags with 9 pieces in each bag. 

3. To find out how many bags he had, we need to divide the number of candies he had left by the number of candies in each bag: 

9 ÷ 9 = 1 

Therefore, Frank had one bag of candy left. 

Answer: Frank had 33 pieces of candy. He lost 24 of them. If he put the remaining pieces into bags with 9 pieces in each bag, he had 1 bag of candy left.</s>

1. First, we need to find out how many apples Jackie has. We know that she has 11 apples and 89 oranges, so we can set up an equation:

11 + x = 89

where x is the number of apples Jackie has. Solving for x, we get:

x = 78

So Jackie has 78 apples.

2. We also know that Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie, so we can add 5 to Jackie's number of apples to find out how many apples Adam has:

Adam's apples = Jackie's apples + 5

Adam's apples = 78 + 5

Adam's apples = 83

Therefore, Adam has 83 apples.</s>

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns. 
Let A be the number of apples Adam has. 
Let J be the number of apples Jackie has. 
Let B be the number of apples Bob has. 

2. From the problem, we know that: 
A = J + 4 (since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie) 
A + J = 14 (since together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples) 

3. We can now substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for J: 
A + J = 14 
A + (J + 4) = 14 
J = 10 

4. Now we can substitute the value of J into the first equation to find A: 
A = J + 4 
A = 10 +

2. We know that Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had "x + 10" marbles.
3. We also know that Doug lost 11 marbles, so he now has "x - 11" marbles.
4. We can use subtraction to find the difference between the number of marbles Doug lost and the number of marbles Ed has: "x - 11" - "x + 10" = "9".
5. Therefore, Ed has "x + 10" - "x - 11" = "20" marbles more than Doug.

Answer: Ed had 20 more marbles than Doug. (20)</s>

1. Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the weight Jessie had before starting to go jogging. 

We know that after she started jogging, she lost 126 kilograms. So her new weight is x - 126. 

We also know that she currently weighs 66 kilograms. So we can set up the equation: 

x - 126 = 66 

To solve for x, we can add 126 to both sides: 

x - 126 + 126 = 66 + 126 

Simplifying: 

x = 192 

Therefore, Jessie weighed 192 kilograms before starting to go jogging.

2. The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped 57 - 5 = 52 inches.
3. To find how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump distance (24 inches) from the mouse's jump distance (52 inches): 52 - 24 = 28.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper. The answer is 28.</s>

1. Let's represent the number of push-ups Zachary did with the variable "x". 
2. We know that David did 30 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can set up an equation: 

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 30 
37 = x + 30 

3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides: 

37 - 30 = x 

4. Now we can solve for x: 

x = 7

1. Let's call the number of blocks Randy had at the start "x".
2. We know that he used 52 blocks to build a tower, so we can set up an equation:
x - 52 = 38
3. To solve for x, we can subtract 52 from both sides:
x - 52 - 52 = 38 - 52
x = 38
4. Therefore, Randy had 38 blocks at the start.

Steps:
1. Let x be the number of blocks Randy had at the start.
2. Set up the equation: x - 52 = 38
3. Subtract 52 from both sides: x - 52 - 52 = 38 - 52

1. Let's start by using variables to represent the unknowns in the problem. 
Let x be the number of houses in a block. 

2. We know that the mailman has to give 25 pieces of junk mail to each block, so we can write an equation: 
25x = 5h 
where h is the number of houses in one block. 

3. We can solve for h by dividing both sides of the equation by 25: 
h = 25x / 25 

4. Now we can substitute x = 5 into the expression for h: 
h = 25(5) / 25 
h = 5 

Therefore, there are 5 houses in one block.

Let J be the number of peaches Jill has. 
Let S be the number of peaches Steven has. 
Let P be the number of peaches Jake has. 

2. From the problem, we know that: 
- S = 13 (Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill) 
- P = S - 18 (Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven) 
- S = 19 (Steven has 19 peaches) 

3. We can use substitution to solve for Jill's peaches: 
- J = S - 18 
- J = 13 + 18 
- J = 31 

Therefore, Jill has 31 peaches.

1. Let's call the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday "x".
2. We know that he had either lost or given away 551 crayons by the end of the school year, so we can set up an equation:
x - 551 = 177
3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 551 to both sides:
x - 551 + 551 = 177 + 551
x = 1128

1. Let's start by assigning a variable to represent the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys. We'll call it "x".
2. We know that Dave had 7 tickets total, and he used some of them to buy toys. So we can set up an equation:
x + the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys = 7
3. We also know that Dave has 2 tickets left, so we can set up another equation:
x + the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys + 2 = 7
4. Now we can solve for the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
x + the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys = 7
x + the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys - 2 = 7 - 2

1. First, we need to find out how many large planks of wood John needs for the house walls. Since each large plank needs 17 nails, we can calculate:

13 large planks x 17 nails per plank = 201 nails

2. Next, we need to add the number of nails needed for the smaller planks. Since each small plank needs 8 nails, we can calculate:

8 small planks x 8 nails per plank = 64 nails

3. Finally, we can add the total number of nails needed for the house walls:

201 nails + 64 nails = 265 nails

Therefore, John needs 265 nails for the house wall. The answer in Arabic numerals is 265.</s>

3. Subtract 22 from both sides of the equation: 22 + x - 22 = 676 - 22
4. Divide both sides by 22: (x - 11) / 22 = 654 / 22
5. Multiply both sides by 22: x - 11 = 654
6. Add 11 to both sides of the equation: x = 665

Therefore, there were 665 pupils in the program. The answer in Arabic numerals is 665.</s>

- We need to find the total number of seats in the Ferris wheel.

2. Use the given information to set up an equation:
- Let x be the number of seats in the Ferris wheel.
- We know that 18 people can ride the wheel at the same time, so we can write: 18 = 9x (since each seat can hold 9 people).

- Number of blocks used for tower = 14 
- Number of blocks used for house = 11 
- Number of blocks left = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used 
- Number of blocks left = 79 - 14 - 11 
- Number of blocks left = 54 

Therefore, Randy has 54 blocks left. The answer in Arabic numerals is 54.</s>

1. Let's assume that Melissa scored 7 points in each game.
2. We know that she scored a total of 21 points.
3. Let's represent the number of games she played with the variable "x".
4. We can write an equation based on the information given:
21 = 7x
5. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7:
21/7 = x/7
6. We can simplify the fraction by multiplying both sides by 7:
21/7 = 7x
7. Finally, we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation:
x = 21/7
8. We can check our answer by substituting x = 21/7 into the original equation:

1 cup of flour = 4 ounces
1 cup of sugar = 8 ounces

To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add now, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the total amount needed and then divide by 4 (since 1 cup is equal to 4 ounces).

Total amount of flour needed = 9 cups
Amount of flour already put in = 2 cups

So, the amount of flour Mary needs to add now = Total amount of flour needed - Amount of flour already put in
= 9 cups - 2 cups
= 7 cups

To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add now, we need to divide the amount of flour she needs to add by the amount of sugar

Let x be the number of apps Dave deleted. 
Let y be the number of files Dave deleted. 

2. We know that Dave started with 17 apps and 21 files, so we can write an equation: 
17 + x = 21 + y 

3. We also know that Dave ended up with 3 apps and 7 files, so we can write another equation: 
3 + x = 7 + y 

4. Now we can solve for x and y by combining the two equations: 
17 + x = 21 + y 
3 + x = 7 + y 

5. Simplifying the left side of the first equation: 
17 + x = 21 + y
