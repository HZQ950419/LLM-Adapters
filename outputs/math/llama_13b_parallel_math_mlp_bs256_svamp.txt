We know that 15 campers went rowing in the morning and x campers went rowing in the afternoon.

Therefore, the total number of campers who went rowing that day is:

15 + x

We also know that the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 32.

So, we can write an equation:

15 + x = 32

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 32 - 15

x = 17

2. According to the problem, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 19 marbles.
3. The problem also tells us that Ed lost some marbles at the playground. Let's say that Ed lost y marbles.
4. After losing y marbles, Ed has x + 19 - y marbles.
5. The problem also tells us that Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 19 - y + 8 marbles.
6. We know that Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug after losing y marbles, so we can set up the equation x + 19 - y + 8 = x + 19 - y.

Let's assume that Dan initially had x amount of money.

According to the problem, Dan bought a candy bar for $ 2. So, the amount of money left with him after buying the candy bar is $ 3.

Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x - 2 = 3

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

x - 2 - 2 = 3 - 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 5

Therefore, Dan initially had $ 5.</s>

Number of Boys = Number of Girls + 142
Number of Boys = 700 + 142
Number of Boys = 842

2. Now that we know the number of boys in the school, we can find the total number of pupils by adding the number of girls and the number of boys:

Total Number of Pupils = Number of Girls + Number of Boys
Total Number of Pupils = 700 + 842
Total Number of Pupils = 1542

3. We also know that there are 692 girls in the school, so we can set up the equation "B + 458 = 692".
4. Solving for "B", we get "B = 692 - 458", which simplifies to "B = 234".
5. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.

2. Edward spent $ 9, so he had x - 9 dollars left.
3. Edward then spent $ 8 more, so he had (x - 9) - 8 dollars left.
4. We know that this amount is equal to $ 17, so we can set up the equation (x - 9) - 8 = 17.
5. Simplifying this equation, we get x - 9 = 25.

3. We also know that 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.
4. Therefore, the total number of students who suggested adding either bacon or mashed potatoes is x + 63 + 457 = 520.
5. We can now find the number of students who suggested adding bacon by subtracting the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes from the total number of students who suggested adding either bacon or mashed potatoes.
