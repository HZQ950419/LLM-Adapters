1. Let x be the height of the shortest player in inches.
2. According to the problem, the tallest player is 9.5 inches taller than the shortest player, so the height of the tallest player is x + 9.5 inches.
3. We also know that the height of the tallest player is 77.75 inches, so we can set up the equation:
x + 9.5 = 77.75
4. Solving for x, we subtract 9.5 from both sides:
x = 77.75 - 9.5
x = 68.25
Therefore, the shortest player is 68.25 inches tall.</s>
