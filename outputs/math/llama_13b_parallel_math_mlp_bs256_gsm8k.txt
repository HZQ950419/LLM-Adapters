1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
3. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.
4. The zoo has 20 sheep.
5. To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows and sheep: 60 + 20 = 80.
6. Therefore, the farm and zoo have a total of 80 animals.

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of the twins and triplets. Let T be the age of one triplet, and let W be the age of one twin.

2. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so W = T + 7.

3. We also know that their combined ages are 44, so T + W = 44.

4. Substituting W = T + 7 into the second equation, we get T + (T + 7) = 44.

5. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get 2T + 7 = 44.

6. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 2T = 37.

7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get T = 18.5.

8. Since we can't have half a person, we round up to the nearest whole number, so both twins are 19 years old.

1. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
2. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
3. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
4. Locsin also caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.
5. To find the total number of fish they caught, we add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish they caught: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.
6. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

1. Let's start by assigning variables to represent the number of cards each person has:
- Let's call the number of cards PJ has "P"
- Let's call the number of cards Smendrick has "S"
- Let's call the number of cards Becca has "B"

2. We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can write an equation:
P + S + B = 341

3. We also know that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can write another equation:
S = 3P

4. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
P + 3P + B = 341

5. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
4P + B = 341

6. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so we can write another equation:
B = S + 12

7. Substituting the second equation into the fifth equation, we get:

1. Let's assume that the number of votes against the new regulation is "x".
2. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.
3. The total number of votes on the council is 33.
4. Therefore, the total number of votes against the new regulation is x, and the total number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.
5. We know that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. So, the total number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, and the total number of votes against the new regulation is x.
6. Therefore, the total number of votes on the council is x + 2x = 33.
7. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 33.

1. Calculate Watson's weekly earnings without the bonus:
Weekly earnings = 10 hours/day x $10/hour = $100/day
Weekly earnings = $100/day x 5 days/week = $500/week

2. Calculate Watson's total monthly earnings without the bonus:
Total monthly earnings = $500/week x 4 weeks/month = $2000/month

3. Calculate Watson's total monthly earnings with the bonus:
Total monthly earnings = $2000/month + $300/week (bonus)
Total monthly earnings = $2000/month + $300/week x 4 weeks/month
Total monthly earnings = $2000/month + $1200/month
Total monthly earnings = $3200/month

1. Let's call the number of students in each of the first two equal groups "x".
2. We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, so the total number of students in the first two equal groups is 2x.
3. We also know that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, so the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.
4. We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, so the total number of students in the first two equal groups plus the smallest group is 2x + x - 10 = 2x + 90.
5. We also know that the total number of students in the class is 200, so the total number of students in the first two equal groups plus the smallest group is 2x + x - 10 = 2x + 90 = 200.

1. Let's start by finding out how much Ariadne made from selling green hats in the first month. We know that her sales from red hats were $400, which is half of what she made from green hats. So, she made $400/2 = $200 from green hats in the first month.

2. In the second month, Ariadne's sales were 3/4 of what she made in the first month. So, her sales from green hats in the second month were 3/4 * $200 = $150.

3. To find out how much she made in two months, we need to add up her sales from red and green hats in both months. In the first month, she made $400 from red hats and $200 from green hats, so her total sales in the first month were $400 + $200 = $600. In the second month, she made $150 from green hats, so her total sales in the second month were $150.

1. Let's start by using algebra to represent the information given in the problem:
- Let's call Leo's age "L".
- Marcus is half of Leo's age, so his age is "M = 0.5L".
- Deanna is five years younger than Marcus, so her age is "D = M - 5 = 0.5L - 5".
- We also know that Deanna is 26 years old, so we can set up an equation: D = 26.

2. Now we can use this equation to solve for Leo's age:
- Substituting D = 26 into the equation for Deanna's age, we get: D = 0.5L - 5.
- Substituting this expression for Deanna's age into the equation for Marcus's age, we get: M = 0.5L - 5.
- Substituting this expression for Marcus's age into the equation for Deanna's age, we get: D = 0.5L - 5.

3. Let's call the length of the shorter piece "x".
4. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. So, the length of the longer piece is 4x.
5. We know that the board is 40 feet long, so we can set up an equation:

x + 4x = 40

6. Simplifying the equation, we get:

5x = 40

7. Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

8. Therefore, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, and the length of the longer piece is 4 times longer, which is:

1. John's house is worth $250,000.
2. He gets a loan worth 40% of that, which is $100,000 (40% of $250,000).
3. He uses 60% of that loan to pay off his debts, which is $60,000 (60% of $100,000).
4. To find out how much money he has leftover, we need to subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total amount of the loan: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.
5. Therefore, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

- Let's call your brother's age "B"
- Let's call your sister's age "S"
- Let's call your age "A"

2. From the problem, we know that:
- A = B - 3 (since you are 3 years younger than your brother)
- A = S + 2 (since you are 2 years older than your sister)
- Mom's age = 3B - 1 (since her age is one less than three times your brother's age)

3. We also know that the sum of all our ages is 87:
A + B + S + Mom's age = 87

4. Substituting the expressions for A and Mom's age in terms of B and S, we get:
A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

$1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each = $3000 - $1200 = $1800

Therefore, the total cost of 240 cups is $1800 more than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

$6000 x 0.5 = $3000
$1800 + $3000 = $4800

The total cost of 240 cups = $4800

To calculate the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups:

$4800 ÷ 240 = $20

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $20.

Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so:

Red rope = 4 * Blue rope

Now we can substitute the expressions for the blue and red ropes in terms of the yellow rope:

Red rope = 4 * (Yellow rope - 7)

We also know that the three ropes have a combined length of 37 centimeters:

Red rope + Blue rope + Yellow rope = 37

Substituting the expressions for the red and blue ropes in terms of the yellow rope, we get:

4 * (Yellow rope - 7) + Yellow rope - 7 + Yellow rope = 37

Simplifying this equation, we get:

5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3D + D/2 = 105.

1. Let's start by finding the cost of one yogurt. We know that the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $6. So, the yogurt costs $6/2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.

2. Next, we need to find the cost of one carrot. We know that Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of one carrot is $2.

3. Now, we can find the total cost of Ellen's goods every day. She eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt, so the total cost is $2 + $6 + $3 = $<<2+6+3=11>>11.

4. Finally, we can find the cost of one carrot per day by dividing the total cost by the number of carrots: $11/2 = $<<11/2=5.5>>5.5.

Therefore, Ellen pays $5.5 for one carrot every day when in total she pays $11 for her goods.</s>

5. Total work time = time spent writing + time spent recording + time spent editing
6. Total work time = 4 + 2 + 90
7. Time spent editing = 90 minutes
8. Time spent editing / total work time = 90/[4 + 2 + 90]
9. Time spent editing / total work time = 90/[4 + 2 + 90]
10. Time spent editing / total work time = 90/[4 + 2 + 90]

1. Let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. We know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so:

Carrey = 1/2 * Carlos
Carrey = 1/2 * 27
Carrey = 13

2. We also know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so:

Jim = Carlos + 5
Jim = 27 + 5
Jim = 32

3. Now we can add up the number of seashells each person collected:

Carrey + Jim + Carlos = 13 + 32 + 27
Carrey + Jim + Carlos = 72

4. To find out how many seashells each person gets, we need to divide the total number of seashells by the number of people:

72 ÷ 3 = 24

Therefore, each person gets 24 seashells.</s>

2. We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. So we can write an equation:

P + (P+10) + J = 100

3. We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. So we can write another equation:

P = (P+10) + J

4. Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(P+10) + J = 100

5. Simplifying this equation, we get:

J = 90

6. Substituting this value for J into the second equation, we get:

P = (P+10) + 90

1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per additional hour

2. Use the rate to find the additional time needed to travel 2000 miles:
2000 miles / 400 miles per additional hour = 5 additional hours

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate. The answer in Arabic numerals is 5.</s>

Jamal's bananas = Jamal's apples + 4
Jamal's bananas = 8 + 4
Jamal's bananas = 12

2. We also know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

Andrea's bananas = 1/2 * Jamal's bananas
Andrea's bananas = 1/2 * 12
Andrea's bananas = 6

3. Now we can find out how many apples Andrea has:

Andrea's apples = Jamal's apples + 8
Andrea's apples = 8 + 8
Andrea's apples = 16

4. Finally, we can find out how many fruits Andrea has in total:

Andrea's fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas
Andrea's fruits = 16 + 6

1. Let's start by finding Mark's current age. We know that two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so we can add 5 to half of Jan's age and then subtract 2 to find Mark's current age.

Mark's age = (1/2) * Jan's age - 2
Mark's age = (1/2) * 30 - 2
Mark's age = 15

2. Now that we know Mark's age, we can use the information given in the problem to find Jean's age. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can add 2 to Mark's age to find Jean's age.

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 15 + 2
Jean's age = 17

Therefore, Jean is currently 17 years old.</s>

2. According to the problem, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, who carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.
3. Let's say Jeffrey carried "y" balls.
4. Therefore, Jason carried 2y balls.
5. And Jordan carried 2(2y) = 4y balls.
6. Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls they carried is 3y.
7. We know that Jason carried 2y balls, so the total number of balls carried by the three boys is 3y + 2y = 5y.
8. We also know that the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is x.
9. Therefore, 5y = x.

- Let's call Wendy's current age "W"
- Let's call Colin's current age "C"
- We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, so we can write: W = 5(C + 7)
- We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so we can write: C + 25 = (W + 25) / 3

2. We can use the first equation to solve for Colin's current age:
- Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: W = 5(C + 7)
- Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get: C + 25 = (5(C + 7) + 25) / 3

1. Let's start by assigning variables to represent the number of insects each person found. Let's say that David found "x" insects.
2. We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can represent Lily's findings as "x + 7".
3. We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can represent Bodhi's findings as "2x".
4. Now we can set up an equation to represent the total number of insects collected: x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 4x + 21 = 43.
6. Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get: 4x = 22.
7. Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 5.5.
8. Since we can't have a fraction of an insect, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, David found 6 insects.
9. To find Lily's findings, we add 7 to David

$99 = cost of boots - 5

3. We want to solve for the cost of the boots, so we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5 from both sides:

$99 - $5 = cost of boots

2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so Millie can make 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.
3. Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so she can make 36 x $1 = $36 from selling lemonade.
4. Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open, so she can make 4 x 24 = 96 cups of lemonade in 24 hours.
5. Millie can make $96 from selling lemonade in 24 hours, so her profit per hour is $96 / 24 = $4.

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $4 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.</s>

Hiking speed = Driving speed - 5 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 50 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 45 miles per hour

2. We also know that it took them 1.5 hours to hike. We can use this information to find the total distance they hiked:

Total distance hiked = Hiking speed x Time hiked
Total distance hiked = 45 miles per hour x 1.5 hours
Total distance hiked = 67.5 miles

3. Now that we know the total distance they hiked, we can use it to find the total distance they drove:

Total distance driven = Total distance hiked + Total distance hiked
Total distance driven = 67.5 miles + 67.5 miles
Total distance driven = 135 miles

4. John then drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours going at a speed of 80 mph, so he covers a distance of 80 * 4 = 320 miles.
5. Therefore, John is 320 - 180 - 15 = 145 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which is 0.5x.
3. The total length of the dress after extending it is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.
4. Shania also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim, so the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20cm.
5. We know that the final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up an equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.
6. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get: 1.5x = 130.

5x - 4 = number of blueberry cubes

where x is the number of strawberry cubes.

2. We know that the total number of ice cubes Mary makes is 116, so we can set up another equation:

x + 5x - 4 = 116

Simplifying this equation, we get:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

x = 20

So Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

1. Let x be the cost of each additional phone.
2. Then the cost of the main phone is 2x.
3. The total cost of the plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones, which is 2x + 5x = 7x.
4. We know that the cost of the main phone is $20, so 2x = $20.
5. Solving for x, we get x = $10.
6. Therefore, the total cost of the plan is 7x = 7(10) = $70.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $70.</s>

1 dozen = 12 eggs
So, Cole hid 3 x 12 = 36 eggs in the yard.
Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
Therefore, the total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.
The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.
The answer is 9.</s>
