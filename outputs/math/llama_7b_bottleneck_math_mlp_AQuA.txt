1. Find the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65:
    - $1023.65 = $1000 + $23.65
    - $1000 is the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65
    - Therefore, the recorded property worth is $1000.

2. Subtract the recorded property worth from the actual property worth to find the difference:
    - $1023.65 - $1000 = $23.65

Therefore, the difference between actual property and recorded property worth is $23.65. The answer is option C) 35.62.</s>

1. First, we need to find the breadth of the rectangular piece of 150 sq m. Since the length is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth, we can set up an equation:

Length = 4 x Breadth + 1

150 = 4 x Breadth + 1

150 = 4B + 1

150 = 4(B - 1)

150 = 4B - 4

150 = 4B

B = 35

So the breadth of the rectangular piece of 150 sq m is 35 meters.

2. Now we can find the perimeter of the rectangular piece of 150 sq m:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Breadth)

Perimeter = 2(150 + 35)

Perimeter = 2(185)

Perimeter = 370

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece of 150 sq m is 370 meters.

1. Let's assume the original price of an item be x.
2. On the first day, the shopkeeper offered a discount of 20%, which means he sold the item at a price of 0.8x.
3. On the second day, the shopkeeper sold the item at the original price of x.
4. To find the percentage increase needed to bring the price back to the original price, we subtract the price on the second day (x) from the price on the first day (0.8x) and then divide by the price on the first day (0.8x).
5. 0.8x - x = 0.2x
6. 0.2x = 0.8x - x
7. 0.2x = 0.6x
8. 0.2x = 0.6(0.8x)

1. First, we need to find the volume of the rectangular solid. 

Volume = length x width x height 
Volume = 3 x 4 x 15 
Volume = 90 cubic feet 

2. Next, we need to find the surface area of the rectangular solid. 

Surface area = 2 x (length x width) 
Surface area = 2 x (3 x 4) 
Surface area = 2 x 24 
Surface area = 48 square feet 

3. Now, we need to find the volume of the sphere. 

Volume of sphere = 4πr^3 
Where r is the radius of the sphere 

4. We know that all eight vertices of the rectangular solid are on the sphere, so we can set up an equation: 

48 = 4πr^3 

5. We can solve for r by dividing both sides by 4π: 

r^3 = 48/4π 
r^3 = 12 
r = 4

We know that the average of H and L is equal to x: 

H + L = x 

We also know that the average score for the entire class is equal to y: 

y = (H + L) / z 

And we know that there are z students in the class, where z > 5: 

z > 5 

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x: 

H + L = x 

y = (H + L) / z 

(H + L) / z = x 

(H + L) / z = y / (H + L) 

(H + L) / (H + L) = y / (H + L) 

y = (H + L) / (H + L) 

y = 1 

So the average score for the entire class is 1.

1. First, we need to find the total distance the plane travels around the square. 

Since the plane travels along the four sides of the square, the total distance is the sum of the distances along each side: 

Total distance = 200 + 400 + 600 + 800 = 1600 km 

2. Next, we need to find the average speed of the plane around the square. 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time 

Average speed = 1600 km / t 

Where t is the time it takes for the plane to travel around the square. 

3. Since the plane travels at different speeds along each side of the square, we need to find the time it takes to travel along each side: 

Time taken to travel along each side = Distance / Speed 

Time taken to travel along each side = 200 km / 200 km/hr = 1 hour 

Time taken to travel along each side = 400 km / 400 km/hr = 1 hour

1. First, we need to find the probability that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election. We can do this by using the formula for the probability of the union of events:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

where P(A or B) is the probability of both events A and B happening, P(A) is the probability of event A happening, P(B) is the probability of event B happening, and P(A and B) is the probability of both events happening given that event A happened.

In this case, we want to find the probability that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election. This can be written as:

P(A and B and C and D and E) = P(A and B) + P(C and D) + P(E) - P(A and B and C and D and E given that A happened)

1. Let's assume the cost price of the appliance be x.
2. According to the problem, the retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, which means they sold it for 140% of the cost price.
3. We can write this as an equation: 140% of x = 20.00
4. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 140% of x:
140% of x = 20.00 ÷ 140% of x
x = 20.00 ÷ 140% of x
x = 20.00 ÷ 0.14x
x = 15.00

1. Let's call the distance between A and B "x".
2. Ram travels at a speed of 20 meters/second, so in 10 seconds he travels 20x meters.
3. Krishna travels at a speed of 40 meters/second, so in 10 seconds he travels 40x meters.
4. We know that Ram and Krishna meet at point C on the road, so their distances from point C are equal. Let's call the distance from point C to A "y".
5. We can set up an equation to solve for x:
y = 20x + 40y
6. Simplifying this equation, we get:

1. First, we need to find the total number of students who took the test. Let's call this number "x".
2. We know that the passing students had an average of 83, so the number of passing students is 83x.
3. We also know that the failing students had an average of 55, so the number of failing students is 55x.
4. We know that the overall class average was 76, so we can set up an equation:
83x + 55x = 76
5. Simplifying this equation, we get:
140x = 76
6. Dividing both sides by 140, we get:
x = 5
7. Therefore, the total number of students who took the test is 5.
8. To find the percentage of students who passed, we need to divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(83x / 5) x 100 = 86

1. Let's assume the cost price of the article be x.
2. The trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, which means he sold it for 120% of its cost price.
3. Therefore, the selling price of the article = 120% of x = 1.2x.
4. We know that profit = selling price - cost price. So, 1.2x = 360.
5. Solving for x, we get x = 300.
Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

1. Let's call the length of the space shuttle "x".
2. We know that at its maximum speed, the space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. This means that the distance it covers in 40 seconds is 700m.
3. We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point. This means that the distance from the space shuttle to the point is 5 seconds x 700m = 3500m.
4. We can set up an equation to solve for x:
700m = 3500m / 40 seconds
x = 3500m / 40 seconds
x = 90 meters
5. Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 90 meters.

1. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange 3 children in a straight line. This can be done by using the combination formula:

nC2 = n(n-1)/2

where n is the number of objects being arranged. In this case, n = 3 (the number of children).

nC2 = 3(3-1)/2
nC2 = 3(2)/2
nC2 = 6

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 3 children in a straight line is 6.

2. Next, we need to find the number of ways to arrange Susan and Tim so that Susan is on the left of Tim. This can be done by using the permutation formula:

nP2 = n(n-1)/2

where n is the number of objects being arranged. In this case, n = 3 (the number of children).

nP2 = 3(3-1)/2
nP2 = 3(2)/2
nP2 = 6

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange Susan and Tim

3/4 x 1/3 = 8/21 

This means that one-third of 3/4 of a number is 8/21 of that number. 

2. We are given that 8/21 of 3/4 of a number is 21. So we can set up an equation:

1. Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of R, T, and Q. Let R's age be x, T's age be y, and Q's age be z.

From the problem, we know that:
- x + y + z = 50 (since the sum of the ages of R, T, and Q is 50)
- x = y + z (since Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T)
- x = y - z (since Q is as much older than T as he is younger than R)

We can use the third equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other two:
- x = y - z
- y = x + z

Now we can substitute these expressions for x and y into the first equation:
- x + y + z = 50
- (x + z) + y = 50

Simplifying this equation, we get:
- 2x + 2z = 50
- 2(x + z) = 50
- 2x + 2y = 25

1. Let the radius of the sphere be r.
2. The volume of the cube is given by V = s^3, where s is the length of one edge of the cube.
3. The volume of the sphere is given by V_s = 4πr^3/3.
4. The ratio of the volumes of the cube and sphere is V_c/V_s = s^3/4πr^3/3.
5. Simplifying this expression, we get s^3/4πr^3 = 2/π.
6. Solving for s, we get s = 2r/π.
7. Substituting this value of s in the expression for V_c, we get V_c = (2r/π)^3 = 8πr^3/2.
8. Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is 8πr^3/2/4πr^3/3 = 8:2.

Weight of silver = 2 x Weight of aluminum
Weight of silver = 2 x 30 grams
Weight of silver = 60 grams

1. Let's call the first odd number "x". Then the second odd number would be "x+2", the third odd number would be "x+4", the fourth odd number would be "x+6", and the fifth odd number would be "x+8".

2. We know that the sum of these five consecutive odd numbers divided by 10 is a perfect square, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 100

3. Simplifying this equation, we get:

5x = 100

4. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

5. So the first odd number is 20, the second odd number is 22, the third odd number is 24, the fourth odd number is 26, and the fifth odd number is 28.

6. To find which of these five consecutive odd numbers can be one of the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers, we need to determine which of these five consecutive

1. First, we need to find the range of the second number, which is less than or equal to the square root of the first. The square root of 99 is 10, so the range of the second number is 0 to 10 inclusive.

2. Next, we need to find pairs of numbers that satisfy the range of the second number. The only possible pairs are (x,y) = (99,10), (85,9), (50,7), (1,1), and (1,0).

3. We can eliminate pairs (99,10) and (85,9) because the first number in each pair is not between 0 and 100 inclusive.

4. We can eliminate pairs (50,7) and (1,1) because the second number in each pair is not less than or equal to the square root of the first.

5. Therefore, the answer is (1,0).</s>

30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. Let's call the original number "x". Then, we have:

x - 30 = (x/3)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x - 30 = x/3

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

3x - 90 = x

Adding 90 to both sides, we get:

3x = 120

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 40

So the original number is 40. To find 50% of that number, we multiply 40 by 0.5:

40 x 0.5 = 20

1. We can start by using the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t)

where:
A = the final amount
P = the original amount
r = the annual interest rate
n = the number of times interest is compounded per year
t = the time in years

In this problem, we know that:

A = $54,080
P = ?
r = 8% compounded semi-annually
n = 2 (since interest is compounded semi-annually)
t = 1 year

We can rearrange the formula to solve for P:

P(1 + r/n)^(n*t) = A

P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1) = $54,080
P(1 + 0.04)^1 = $54,080
P(1 + 0.04)^1 = $54,080
P(1 + 0.04)^1 = $54,080

[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/[13 × 13 - 156]
= (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/[13 × 13]
= (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/[13 × 1]
= (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/13
= (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/13 × 13
= (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/13 × 13 × 13
= (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/13 × 13 × 13 × 13
= (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/13 × 13 × 13 ×

1. First, we need to find the total work done by x men working x hours per day for x days:

Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x hours per day) x (x days)
Total work = (x men) x (x
