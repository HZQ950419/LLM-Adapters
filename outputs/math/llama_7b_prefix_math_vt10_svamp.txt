We also know that Baker sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries. So we can write another equation:

Now we can solve for x: 

52 + x = 84 

102 + x = 94 

Add: 

102 + 52 = 94 + x

Since a square foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 168 square inches to square feet by multiplying by 12: 

168 square inches x 12 square feet/12 square inches = 20 square feet 

So, Jesse's room needs a carpet of 20 square feet.

where "e" is Ed's number of marbles.

We also know that after losing some marbles, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug. So we can write:

d + 8 = f

where "f" is Doug's new number of marbles.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(d + 19) + 8 = e

Simplifying this equation:

d + 27 = e

According to the problem, Baker sold 8 pastries and 97 cakes. So we can write an equation:

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides: 

x = 95 

So Baker sold 95 pastries. 

Now we can use the same equation to find the number of cakes Baker sold:

Let x be the number of files Dave deleted. 

According to the problem, Dave had 24 files and 13 apps initially. So we can write: 

24 + 13 = x 

We can solve for x by subtracting 24 from both sides: 

x = 11 

So Dave deleted 11 files. 

To find out how many apps he deleted, we can subtract the number of files he deleted from the total number of apps: 

13 - 11 = 2 

So Dave deleted 2 apps.

Let x be the number of apps Dave deleted. 

According to the problem, after deleting some apps and files he had 12 apps and 30 files left. So we can write an equation: 

59 + x - 15 = 12 + 30 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides: 

59 + x - 15 - 15 = 12 + 30 - 15 

Simplifying: 

44 + x = 17

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of baskets. 

According to the problem, each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches. 

We can set up an equation to represent this information: 

4x + 6x = 10 

Simplifying, we get: 

10x = 10 

Dividing both sides by 10, we get: 

x = 1 

Therefore, there are 1 basket of peaches. 

To find the total number of baskets, we can multiply x by 10: 

10x = 100 

Dividing both sides by 10, we get: 

x = 10

Let's start by assigning a variable to Doug's number of marbles. Let's call it "d".

According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. So we can write:

d + 2 = Ed's number of marbles

We also know that Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug. So we can write:

d + 2 + 19 = Ed's new number of marbles

Subtracting 19 from both sides, we get:

d + 2 = Ed's new number of marbles - 19

Simplifying, we get:

d + 2 = 17

d = 15

So Doug had 15 marbles to begin with.

To find out how many marbles Doug lost, we can subtract his original number of marbles

To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each grade. 

First, we need to find the total number of students in each grade: 

5 students/grade x 5 grades = 25 students/grade 

Next, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students in each grade to find the number of grades: 

270 students ÷ 25 students/grade = 11 grades 

Therefore, there are 11 grades in total. 

The steps are: 
1. Find the total number of students in each grade: 5 students/grade x 5 grades = 25 students/grade
2. Divide the total number of students by the number of students in each grade to find the number of grades: 270 students ÷ 25

I'm sorry for the mistake. Here's the correct solution:

Rachel had to complete 10 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 3 more pages of reading homework than math homework, then she had to complete a total of 10 + 3 = 13 pages of homework.

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 13 pages of homework in all.

Steps:
1. Write down the given information: Rachel had to complete 10 pages of math homework.
2. Write down the additional information: If she had to complete 3 more pages of reading homework than math homework, then she had to complete a total of 10 + 3 = 13 pages of homework.

Let's start by assigning a variable to represent the number of crackers Matthew gave to his friends. Let's call it "x".

According to the problem, Matthew had 31 crackers. After giving equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends, he was left with 23 crackers. So we can set up an equation:

31 = x + 5x

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5x from both sides:

31 - 5x = 23 - 5x

Simplifying the left side:

26 = 23 - 5x

Subtracting 5x from both sides:

26 - 5x = 23 - 5x

14 square feet is equal to 14 x 12 = 168 square inches.

Since a square foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 168 square inches to square feet by multiplying by 12: 

168 square inches x 12 square feet/12 square inches = 20 square feet 

So, Jesse's room needs a carpet that is 20 square feet. 

To find the width of the room, we need to divide the length by the width:

1. Let's start by assigning a variable to represent the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon. Let's call it "letters".
2. We know that Jack received a total of 5 emails in the day, so we can set up an equation:
5 = x + y
3. We also know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning, so we can substitute that into the equation:
5 = 4 + y
4. Now we can solve for "y":
y = 5 - 4
y = 1
5. Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon.

Let's start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. 

Let x be the number of peaches Jake has. 
Let y be the number of apples Jake has. 

From the problem, we know that: 

- Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven: x = 19 - 12 = 7 
- Jake has 79 more apples than Steven: y = 14 + 79 = 93 

We can use substitution to solve for x: 

x = 19 - 12 
x = 7 

Now we can use substitution again to solve for y: 

y = 14 + 79 
y = 93 

Therefore, Jake has 7 peaches and 93 apples.

Let x be the amount of money Dan had initially. 

According to the problem, he spent $ 2 on a candy bar. 

So we can write an equation:

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

We can do this by dividing both sides by 2: 

x = 2 

Therefore, Dan had $ 2 initially. 

To find out how much money he had left, we can subtract the cost of the candy bar from his initial amount:

1. Robin's hair was 14 inches long.
2. It grew by 8 inches.
3. Then he cut off 20 inches.
4. To find out how long his hair is now, we need to subtract the growth and the cut from the original length.

Step 1: Subtract the growth from the original length.
14 inches - 8 inches = 6 inches

Step 2: Subtract the cut from the new length.
6 inches - 20 inches = 14 inches

Therefore, Robin's hair is now 14 inches long.</s>

Let's start by finding out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 17 - 6 = 11 peaches.

We also know that Jake has 8 more apples than Steven, so he has 16 + 8 = 24 apples.

To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we need to subtract the number of apples from the number of peaches. 

Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples, so he has 17 - 16 = 1 more peach than apple. 

Therefore, Steven has 1 more peach than apple. 

The answer is: 

Steven has 1 more peach than apple.</s>

Let x be the number of cakes Baker made after selling 71 of them. 

According to the problem, Baker made 111 more cakes than he sold. So we can write an equation: 

x + 111 = 144 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 111 from both sides: 

x + 111 - 111 = 144 - 111 

Simplifying: 

x = 33

According to the problem, Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books. So we can write: 

92x = 16 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 92: 

x = 0.167 

So one book costs $0.167. 

Now we can use this value to find out how much Edward had before spending his money. 

Let y be the amount of money Edward had before spending his money. 

We know that Edward spent $16, so we can write: 

y - 16 = 92x

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of pieces of candy Bobby ate. 

According to the problem, we know that: 

x + 32 = 20 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 32 from both sides: 

x + 32 - 32 = 20 - 32 

Simplifying: 

x = -20 

So Bobby ate -20 pieces of candy. 

To check our answer, we can substitute x = -20 into the original equation: 

32 + x = 20 

Subtracting 32 from both sides: 

x = 20 

Therefore, Bobby a

To find the cost of each pack, we need to divide the total cost by the number of packs. 

Total cost = 6 packs x $120 

To find the cost of each pack, we need to divide the total cost by the number of packs: 

Cost of each pack = Total cost / Number of packs 

Cost of each pack = $120 / 6 

Cost of each pack = $20 

Therefore, each pack costs $20. 

The steps are: 

1. Multiply the total cost by the number of packs: 

$120 x 6 = $720 

2. Divide the total cost by the number of packs:

According to the problem, Paco ate 19 cookies and had 35 cookies left. So we can write an equation: 

x - 19 = 35 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 19 from both sides: 

x - 19 - 19 = 35 - 19 

Simplifying: 

x - 19 = 16 

Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by -19: 

x = 16 + 19 

x = 35 

Therefore, Paco had 35 cookies in the beginning

Let's use "x" to represent the number of bottle caps Danny had at first. 

According to the problem, Danny lost 66 bottle caps at the park. This means he had "x + 66" bottle caps in total. 

We also know that Danny now has 25 bottle caps in his collection. So we can set up the equation: 

x + x + 66 = 25 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2x + 66 = 25 

Subtracting 66 from both sides, we get: 

2x = 19 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 

x = 9 

Therefore, Danny had 9 bottle caps at first.

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. Let x be the number of games Kelly had initially. 

According to the problem, Kelly gave away 91 games. So we can set up an equation: 

x - 91 = 92 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 91 from both sides: 

x - 91 - 91 = 92 - 91 

Simplifying: 

x = 1 

Therefore, Kelly had 1 game initially. 

To check our answer, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation: 

1 - 91 = 92 - 91 

Simplifying: 

1 = 1 

So the answer is 1.

Dave won 18 tickets.
He used 5 tickets to buy some toys.
He used 11 more tickets to buy some clothes.
To find out how many tickets Dave had left, we need to subtract the number of tickets used from the total number of tickets won.

Total number of tickets won = 18
Number of tickets used = 5
Number of tickets left = Total number of tickets won - Number of tickets used
Number of tickets left = 18 - 5

Let x be the number of goldfish that disappeared. 

According to the problem, Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond. So we can write an equation: 

16 + 71 = 87 

To solve for x, we can subtract 16 from both sides: 

71 = 65 + x 

Simplifying: 

71 = 65 + x 

Subtracting 65 from both sides: 

x = 6 

So Paige had 6 goldfish disappear from the pond.

Let x be the number of boys in the school. 

According to the problem, the number of girls is 739. 

We know that the number of girls is 402 more than the number of boys. So we can write an equation: 

x + 402 = 739 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 402 from both sides: 

x + 402 - 402 = 739 - 402 

Simplifying: 

x = 337

We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. 

Let x be the number of cookies Paco ate. 

According to the problem: 

- Paco had 28 cookies. 
- He ate some of them, so he had 7 cookies left. 

We can set up an equation to represent this information: 

28 + x = 7 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 28 from both sides: 

28 + x - 28 = 7 - 28 

Simplifying: 

x = 7 

Therefore, Paco ate 7 cookies. 

The answer in Arabic numerals is: 

Paco ate 7 cookies. (7)</s>

I'm sorry for the mistake. Here's the correct solution:

Every day, Ryan spends 6 hours on learning English and 5 hours on learning Chinese. If he learns for 2 days, how many hours does he spend on learning English in all?

Let's assume that Ryan spends x number of hours on learning English on the first day and y number of hours on the second day.

So, the total number of hours spent by Ryan on learning English = x + y

Similarly, the total number of hours spent by Ryan on learning Chinese = 6 + 5 = 11

Therefore, the total number of hours spent by Ryan on learning English and Chinese = x + y + 11

We know that Ryan learns for 2 days, so the total number of hours spent by Ryan on learning English and Chinese = 2 days * 24 hours/day
